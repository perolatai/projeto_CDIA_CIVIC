The TRK pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancer types, with NTRK fusions being the best characterized. Larotrectinib and entrectinib are NTRK inhibitors that are FDA approved for patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, including tumors with ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, and are reported to have durable NTRK inhibition. Evaluating response of ETV6-NTRK3 fusion in B-ALL cases to larotrectinib is difficult due to the rarity of the fusion in this cancer type. However, in a limited number of clinical cases of ETV6-NTRK3 in B-ALL, patients harboring these fusions have responded to larotrectinib. One patient demonstrated a response to treatment that was lost on discontinuation of therapy but showed durable response achieving remission on restarting laroterctinib [civic:eid8917]. The functional impact of ETV6-NTRK3 has been demonstrated through increased tumorigenic properties in mice, which mimic human B-ALL [civic:eid8931] and enhanced sensitivity to Larotrectinib both in vivo and in vitro [civic:eid6930].
