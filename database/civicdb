The authors sought to understand whether the addition of vemurafenib (a BRAF V600E inhibitor) to agents approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer increased therapeutic efficacy, and which combinations worked best. Capecitabine, bevacizumab and vemurafenib combination therapy resulted in 100% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and 190% increased lifespan (ILS) compared to vehicle treated controls. Seven mice experienced partial response and two experienced complete response.

99	673	Colorectal Cancer	9256.0	None	Vemurafenib	None	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study examined vemurafenib efficacy on various colorectal cancer cell lines and in mouse xenograft experiments. Of the cell lines tested, six harbored BRAF V600E (and WT KRAS) and three harbored BRAF WT (but mutant KRAS). Of the six BRAF V600E expressing cell lines, four were sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50 ranging between 0.025 and 0.35 uM; HT29, Colo205, Colo741, LS411N). Cell lines expressing the BRAF V600E mutation responded better to vemurafenib treatment than cells wildtype for BRAF as measured by reduced cellular proliferation and inhibition of MET and ERK phosphorylation (none of the three BRAF wt cell lines had IC50s less than 10uM). Authors note that one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO) harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95% tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle treated controls).	22180495	PubMed	Yang et al., 2012, Cancer Res.	2.0	accepted	12	7	Somatic	f

Of those, 30 patients harbored BRAF V600E, were KRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. One patient (who harbored BRAF V600E in low copy number) responded, 11 had stable disease, and 18 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=20), cetuximab monotherapy (n=5), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=4), and cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=1). Median PFS was 8 weeks (2-32 weeks), median OS was 25 weeks (4-237 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 61 years old (42-78) and there were 16 males and 14 females. Authors concluded that BRAF mutation (23/24 of mutants were BRAF V600E) was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of BRAF is more informative than those of NRAS and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response (second only to KRAS).	20619739	PubMed	De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.	3.0	accepted	12	7	Somatic	f

384	5290	Colorectal Cancer	9256.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	Poor Outcome	This study analyzed tumor and patient characteristics from 1,170 colorectal cancer patients derived from the prospective cohort studies: Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow Up Study. PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of patients via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples. Of patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors, 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10 (listed as exon 9 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). The presence of an exon 10 mutation was not significantly associated with differences in colorectal cancer-specific or overall survival when compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (multivariate, stage-stratified HR = 1.15 vs 1). Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed	Liao et al., 2012, Clin. Cancer Res.	2.0	accepted	106	3	Somatic	f

The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.	18227510	PubMed	Yun et al., 2008, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	5.0	accepted	34	7	Somatic	f

Of patients harboring KIT exon 11 mutated GISTs, 71 (83.5%) had a partial response, 7 had stable disease, 4 had progressive disease and 3 were nonassessable.  Patients with KIT exon 11 mutations were significantly more likely to have a partial response than those with KIT exon 9 mutations (P=.0006)  or double WT kinases (WT KIT and WT PDGFRA; P < .0001). The presence of a KIT exon 11 mutation was the strongest predictor of response (Hazard ratio= 7.85). Patients harboring KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced longer event free survival (median: 687 days) than those with  KIT exon 9 mutant or double WT kinase GISTs (200 days and 82 days, respectively). Furthermore, patients whose tumors expressed an exon 11 mutant KIT had improved overall survival compared to patients whose tumor expressed an exon 9 mutant KIT (P = .0034)  or double WT kinases (P <.0001).	14645423	PubMed	Heinrich et al., 2003, J.

One ALK+ patient harbored the common E6;A20 fusion with ALK G1269A co-mutation in post-crizotinib progression biopsies. The presence of ALK G1269A pre-crizotinib could not be evaluated. This patient was a 21 year old non-smoking male with adenocarcinoma, wt for KRAS and EGFR, negative for ALK copy number gain, who experienced crizotinib as a 2nd line therapy. The patient's best response on crizotinib was stable disease (377 days on treatment). In vitro, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK fusion (E6a;A20, a known sensitizing alteration) and ALK G1269A co-mutation demonstrated resistance to crizotinib treatment (341 nmol/L vs. 22 nmol/L) compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability and colony formation. Levels of phosphorylation of ALK, ERK, STAT3, and AKT were higher in ALK+ G1269A mutant cells than ALK+ controls, by western blot. The authors note that ALK G1269A likely induces resistance by preventing crizotinib from accessing its binding pocket in the ALK kinase domain.	22235099	PubMed	Doebele et al., 2012, Clin.

Of 17 patients with BRAF V600E melanoma, 4 achieved partial response, 5 experienced stable disease lasting longer than 16 weeks, and 8 experienced disease progression (including 2 with prior vemurafenib treatment). One of the partial responders had a concomitant EGFR mutation, and two of the stable disease patients had other concomitant mutations (in RET or MET). The median days on treatment was 113 (18-366) for BRAF V600E melanoma patients and 107 (17-323) for BRAF V600 wildtype patients (n=23). Patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma experienced similar response rates (24% vs 20%) and rates of metabolic response measured by decrease in FDG uptake assessed by FDG-PET (86% vs 75%) compared to non-BRAF mutant patients. Patients with melanoma, either BRAF wt or V600E, experienced significant decreases in Ki67 expression by day 15 of MEK inhibitor treatment (P<0.02).

Of 18 patients with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 10 experienced clinical benefit: 2 partial responses and 8 patients experiencing stable disease for longer than 8 weeks. The median days on treatment was 58.5 (13-394) with one patient ongoing treatment at the end of the study period (56 weeks).

1009	2064	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	60079.0	None	Lapatinib,Trastuzumab	Combination	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	This Phase III study (EGF104900) was motivated by preclinical and other data demonstrating synergistic activity between lapatinib and trastuzumab against HER2 positive breast cancer (BC) cells.  In this study of HER2 positive metastatic BC which had progressed on trastuzumab, two arms were compared: lapatinib vs. lapatinib + trastuzumab. Progression free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. For 296 patients, 148 in each arm, median PFS of 8.1 weeks for lapatinib and 12.0 for combination therapy was observed (P=0.008).  The authors conclude that in the context of metastatic trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive BC, trastuzumab with lapatinib TKI addition is a favorable treatment.	20124187	PubMed	Blackwell et al., 2010, J.

From 41 treated patients, 10% had partial response, 37% had stable disease as best response and 46% achieved clinical benefit.  Median progression free survival (PFS) was 15.1 weeks and median overall survival (OS) was 61.0 weeks. The authors conclude that Afatinib monotherapy shows promise in treatment of metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer that has progressed under trastuzumab.	22418700	PubMed	Lin et al., 2012, Breast Cancer Res.

Benefit was seen in 30% of 40 patients assigned to afatinib alone, 34.2% of 38 assigned to afatinib plus vinorelbine, and 41.9% of 43 assigned to investigator's treatment choice.  Differences were not statistically significant, and afatanib patients experienced more adverse effects.  While Afatanib did show response in HER2 breast cancer patients, it was not better than investigator's treatment choice and the investigators state that no further development of afatinib for HER2 breast cancer will be planned.	26596672	PubMed	Cortés et al., 2015, Lancet Oncol.	3.0	accepted	306	17	Somatic	f
1012	2064	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	60079.0	None	Afatinib	None	Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Sensitivity/Response	LUX-Breast 1 is a phase 3 trial (NCT01125566) which enrolled 508 patients with metastatic HER2 positive BC who had progressed after adjuvant or first-line trastuzumab. It was thought that the wider range of ErbB family blocking and irreversible properties of afatinib could be beneficial in trastuzumab resistant cancer cells, since ErbB family members are thought to play a role in trastuzumab resistance. Primary endpoint was intention-to-treat group PFS. 339 patients were assigned to afatanib + vinorelbine and 169  to trastuzumab + vinorelbine.  Recruitment was stopped prematurely when it was deemed unlikely that the increased PFS would be seen in the afatinib group. Median PFS was 5.5 months in the afatinib group and 5.6 months in the trastuzumab group.  Afatanib plus vinorelbine was less well tolerated than trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, and the authors conclude that trastuzumab remains the best choice for treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC.	26822398	PubMed	Harbeck et al., 2016, Lancet Oncol.	4.0	accepted	306	17	Somatic	f

The irreversible TKI afatinib blocks EGFR, HER2, ErbB3 and ErbB4.  Thus afatinib was studied in this Phase I trial of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC (MBC) in combination with continued trastuzumab treatment, where trastuzumab is still the perferred treatment for trastuzumab-progressed MBC.  Objective response and disease control rates were 11% and 39%.  The authors conclude that the clinical activity observed in this trial warrants further work with afatinib and trastuzumab combination therapy.	25370464	PubMed	Ring et al., 2015, Clin.

While trastuzumab has not shown clear benefit yet in wild-type HER2 overexpressed NSCLC, the authors conclude that further prospective studies should be done with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in advanced HER2 mutant NSCLC, and that trastuzumab plus chemotherapy should be considered in current treatment courses of this cancer type.	26598547	PubMed	Mazières et al., 2016, Ann.

1044	2064	Lung Small Cell Carcinoma	5409.0	None	Irinotecan,Trastuzumab	Combination	Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	This report details 2 case studies in relapsed HER2 positive SCLC.  In the first case, a 50 pack-year patient showed intense non-mutant HER2 expression by IHC without DNA amplification, and had undergone multiple prior lines of treatment.  With induction of trastuzumab and irinotecan treatment, tumor regression was observed with progression free survival of 4.5 months.  Case 2 involved a 68 year old never-smoker with relapsed SCLC.  Tumor showed HER2 positive SCLC cells with no amplification or mutation.  Third line trastuzumab plus irinotecan brought about some symptom improvement and PFS of 3.5 months.  While the efficacy of trastuzumab against NSCLC with elevated levels of wild-type HER2 expression remains unclear, the authors conclude that trastuzumab based therapy is a promising strategy for chemo-resistant SCLC.	25601188	PubMed	Kinehara et al., 2015, Lung Cancer	4.0	accepted	306	17	Somatic	f

Induction of mutant HER2 in these mice drove rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors, where tumor maintenance was dependent on continued YMVA HER2 induction by doxycycline.  Administration of afatinib had a stronger effect than erlotinib or trastuzumab, as measured by histology and tumor volume regression.  Authors state that in the case of afatinib vs. trastuzumab, intracellular HER2 signaling may be blocked by afatanib but remain unaltered by trastuzumab.	19122144	PubMed	Perera et al., 2009, Proc.

Overexpression of HEF1 protein was observed in HCC tissue when compared with their adjacent non-malignant liver tissue. High expression of HEF1 correlated with higher advanced tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage and vascular invasion (P<0.05). In univariate and multivariate analysis, the expression of HEF1 was identified as an independent prognostic factor (Spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression model). In subgroup analysis, high expression of HEF1 correlated with a poorer prognosis in advanced (TNM III+IV) stages (P<0.05).	26893853	PubMed	Li et al., 2016, Mol Clin Oncol	3.0	accepted	444	6	None	f

Earlier deaths were seen with heavier HER2 expression.  Multivariate Cox regression indicated that shorter survival was associated with higher HER2 expression, and not with age or ethnicity, and that observed differences in survival rates between ethnicities can be ascribed to higher rates of HER2 overexpression in African American patients.

HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women.  This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH.  Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy.  Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL.  The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation.  Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered.  After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL.  The investigators conclude there is promise in trastuzumab-based therapies in advanced endometrial cancers, including USPC.	18555254	PubMed	Santin et al., 2008, Int J Gynaecol Obstet	4.0	accepted	306	17	Somatic	f

Participants had stage III, IV or recurrent HER2 positive endometrial cancer.  During the trial's initial phase, 23 of 132 patients screened met the criteria of IHC2+ or 3+ or FISH positivity for HER2 status.  In the absence of results, the trial entered phase B, where only patients with HER2 amplification by FISH were admitted.  The trial ended early due to poor accrual with 11 of 154 screened meeting the phase B criteria. No major objective tumor responses were observed in the study.  28% of the cancers were of the serous type that had shown trastuzumab response in case studies.  The investigators note that in other HER2 cancers, such as breast and gastrointestinal, trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been found most effective, and could warrant more study.  Currently a clinical trial (NCT01367002) is evaluating carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in uterine serous cancer.	19840887	PubMed	Fleming et al., 2010, Gynecol.

1102	4869	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	Peripheral blood from NPM1 mutated AMLs was assessed for NPM1 mutation status at multiple time points using RT-qPCR with primers designed to amplify different mutant NPM1 transcripts. The test development cohort consisted of 194 cases and an independent validation cohort consisted of 91 cases. Persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in blood was present in 15% of the patients after the second chemotherapy cycle. This persistence was associated with a greater risk of relapse after 3 years of follow-up than was an absence of such transcripts (82% vs. 30%; hazard ratio, 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95 to 7.80; P<0.001) and a lower rate of survival (24% vs. 75%; hazard ratio for death, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.57 to 7.47; P<0.001). The presence of minimal residual disease was the only independent prognostic factor for death in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.57 to 9.15; P<0.001). On sequential monitoring of minimal residual disease, relapse was reliably predicted by a rising level of NPM1-mutated transcripts.	26789727	PubMed	Ivey et al., 2016, N. Engl. J.

Knockdown of WRD5 in 32D cells (mouse hematopoietic cell line) or transplanted primary mouse bone marrow expressing the p30 isoform restored myeloid differentiation in these cells. OICR-9429, a small molecule inhibitor of WRD5, and anti-WRD5 siRNAs selectively inhibited colony formation of mouse fetal liver cells homozygous for N-terminal CEBPA mutations but not wildtype colony formation. Finally, OICR-9429 reduced viability of primary human AML blasts harboring N-terminal domain CEBPA mutations in culture but not AML blasts with other mutations. Taken together, WRD5 inhibition is a potential therapeutic method for patients harboring N-terminal CEBPA mutations.	26167872	PubMed	Grebien et al., 2015, Nat. Chem.

Efficacy of MEK inhibitors (GDC-0623 and G-573) in KRAS-driven tumours is mediated by a hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. This mechanism was distinct from GDC-0973 which is less potent in KRAS mutant tumors. Overall, this work indicates that MEK inhibitors with this mechanism of action will be most effective in patients with both BRAF and KRAS mutations.	23934108	PubMed	Hatzivassiliou et al., 2013, Nature	3.0	accepted	336	12	Somatic	f

Patients were required to have prior exposure to trastuzumab and lapatinib as well as a taxane.  This patient population has not seen many studies, responds poorly to late-line treatment with trastuzumab, and in this study was treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, n=404) vs. physician's choice (usually trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=198).  Results showed progression free survival was 6.2 months in T-DM1 treatment vs. 3.3 months under physician's choice, along with lower incidence of grade 3 or worse events with T-DM1.  The authors conclude that their findings in this heavily pretreated population, along with findings in the EMILIA trial, indicate promise for antibody-drug conjugates.

Patients were required to have progressed on or after treatments involving trastuzumab and a taxane, and no prior exposure to lapatinib or T-DM1.   Primary endpoints included independently assessed progression free survival (PFS) and safety. PFS was 9.6 months in T-DM1 group vs. 6.4 months in lapatinib plus capecitabine.  Rates of adverse events of grade 3 or higher were greater with lapatinib plus capecitabine.  These results, together with other trials such as TH3RESA indicate promise for T-DM1 therapy in HER2 amplification, and this will be further studied in an arm of the NCI-MATCH trial.	23020162	PubMed	Verma et al., 2012, N.

Results from a mass spectrometry-based assay to evaluate KRAS activity suggests that G12C mutant KRAS is in a “hyperexcitable” rather than a “statically active” state. ARS-853 targets the inactive state and inhibited proliferation in a subset  (3/11) of KRAS G12C mutant cell lines in 2-D growth assays and 11/11 cell lines in soft-agar colony formation and 3-D assays. This effect was specific for KRAS G12C as 12/12 cell lines with other KRAS mutations (including other G12 mutations V, D and A) were not inhibited in either soft-agar assay.  Relative resistance to ARS-853 developed after epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL) administration and the combination of erlotinib or afatinib (EGFR-inhibitors) with ARS-853 greatly potentiated growth arrest, apoptosis and decrease of PI3K and MAPK-signaling over single-agent ARS-853 treatment, even in the presence of added EGF.	26739882	PubMed	Patricelli et al., 2016, Cancer Discov	3.0	accepted	78	12	Somatic	f

Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation.  BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC,  and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.	17625570	PubMed	Soda et al., 2007, Nature	5.0	accepted	5	2	Somatic	f

This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.	18927303	PubMed	Takeuchi et al., 2008, Clin.

Variants of uncertain significance were: a missense variant in ERBB2 and a missense variant in KDR at amino acid 961 converting the wild type residue, Arginine, to Tryptophan (frequency 28.25%). Because of the high frequency of the KDR (VEGFR2) mutation, the patient was considered a suitable candidate for a VEGFR inhibitor and received regorafenib monotherapy, which is approved for this situation, at 80mg daily which was later reduced to 40mg daily and had CEA normalization as well as partial metabolic and radiologic response. The patient remained almost asymptomatic and without disease progression after 39 weeks.	27004155	PubMed	Loaiza-Bonilla et al., 2016, Cureus	1.0	accepted	502	4	Somatic	f
1192	238	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908.0	None	2,4-pyrimidinediamine	None	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	In a cohort of 75 NSCLC patients that had tested positive for 3 EML4-ALK rearrangements, two individuals were identified via RT-PCR with a novel EML4-ALK translocation involving the first 6 exons of EML4 fused to the kinase domain of ALK. Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20.  3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice.  The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line.  The results indicate that 3a/b is a targetable driver-mutation as other EML4-ALK variants.	18593892	PubMed	Choi et al., 2008, Cancer Res.	4.0	accepted	503	2	Somatic	f
1193	238	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908.0	None	Crizotinib	None	Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	In a set of 31 patients with NSCLC, RT-PCR was performed to test for known EML4-ALK variants.  Five patients tested positive for the 3a/3b EML4-ALK variant.  Of these, 4 had partial response (PR), and one had disease progression (DP), and this was the only DP in the group of 31.  In contrast, of the 13 testing positive for EML4-ALK variant 1, 12 showed PR, and 1 showed stable disease.  These results potentially mirror findings in the H2228 3a/3b containing NSCLC cell line where some literature indicates it does respond as strongly to ALK inhibition as other EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines.	20979469	PubMed	Kwak et al., 2010, N.

Of these, NCI-H2228 harbored EML4-ALK variant 3a/b (EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20).

The cell lines NCI-H3122 (containing EML4-ALK variant 1) and NCI-H2228 (containing the EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20 fusion-variant 3a/3b) were identified. TAE684 (0.1uM) appreciably inhibited growth as well as Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in variant 1 containing H3122 cells. However, incomplete inhibition in 3a/3b containing H2228 cells was observed. H2228 growth inhibition by TAE684 was more similar to NSCLC cell lines harboring KRAS and EGFR mutations.	18594010	PubMed	Koivunen et al., 2008, Clin. Cancer Res.	2.0	accepted	503	2	Somatic	f
1196	238	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908.0	None	Crizotinib	None	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus.  While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.	22912387	PubMed	Heuckmann et al., 2012, Clin.

The primary endpoint - progression free survival (PFS) - was found to be significantly better for patients treated with crizotinib (median 7.7 months) than with chemotherapy (median 3.0 months) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). Response rates were 65% for crizotinib treatment and 20% for chemotherapy (P<0.001). Improvements in quality of life were also reported.	23724913	PubMed	Shaw et al., 2013, N. Engl. J.

Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to crizotinib (N=172) or pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin (N=171). Progression free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (10.9 vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.60;P<0.001), and objective response rate was higher with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (75% vs. 45%, P<0.001).

No gross imbalances in clinicopathologic features of the two groups were evident.  Significantly longer overall survival was observed in the crizotinib continuing group from time of PD (16.4 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17–0.42; P < 0.0001), and from the time of initial crizotinib (29.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–0.46; P < 0.0001).	24478318	PubMed	Ou et al., 2014, Ann.

The study did not reach the targeted endpoint of 20% ORR. However, of 3/12 patients found to be ALK-rearranged via break apart FISH assay, 2 showed a partial response and the third stable disease, which was durable for 7.2 months. The authors note that the break apart FISH assay used to determine ALK-rearrangement status does not determine the identity of the ALK fusion partner and the promising results shown here may be dependent on the nature of the ALK fusion partner.	20940188	PubMed	Sequist et al., 2010, J.

IPI-504 treatment caused regression of H3122 tumors in nude mice, whereas Hsp90 inhibitors usually only cause growth inhibition in these models.  Combined treatment of these mice with IPI-504 and crizotinib caused an even stronger tumor regression.	21258415	PubMed	Normant et al., 2011, Oncogene	4.0	accepted	5	2	Somatic	f
1204	238	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908.0	None	Alvespimycin,Crizotinib	Combination	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	EML4-ALK fusions occur in 2-7% of lung adenocarcinomas. Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) caused the cells to grow independently of IL3 addition.  EML4-ALK may be a client protein of Hsp90. Addition of Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG to the EML4-ALK variant 2 cells induced cell death which was rescued at lower 17-DMAG concentrations by IL3 addition. This result suggests that 17-DMAG specifically  targeted the EML4-ALK driver in these cells. Finally, 17-DMAG and crizotinib showed a synergistic effect in killing EML4-ALK variant 2 cells.	22912387	PubMed	Heuckmann et al., 2012, Clin. Cancer Res.	2.0	accepted	500	2	Somatic	f

While incubation of Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants 1 and 2 with Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG caused cell death that was reversible with IL3 addition, Ba/F3 cells with variant 3a were not sensitized to 17-DMAG induced death, suggesting that 17-DMAG was effecting the EML4-ALK driver of IL3-independant proliferation. This in turn suggests that variant 3a may not rely on Hsp90 for stability in cancer cells to the extent of other variants.	22912387	PubMed	Heuckmann et al., 2012, Clin.

The degree of Hsp90 dependence, and targetability of EML4-ALK for Hsp90 inhibition, may vary among ALK fusion variants.  Addition of crizotinib to 17-DMAG caused synergistic death effects, suggesting potential clinical benefit for this inhibitor combination in targeting EML4-ALK variant 1.	22912387	PubMed	Heuckmann et al., 2012, Clin.

Cancers predominantly included hepatocellular carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, and histiocytic sarcoma, as well as other tumor types. In S47/wild-type heterozygote mice an increased cancer incidence, with a predisposition for hepatocellular carcinoma, was also found. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with S47 mutations were significantly less sensitive to cisplatinum treatment compared to TP53 wild-type cells (apoptosis and viability).	27034505	PubMed	Jennis et al., 2016, Genes Dev.	2.0	accepted	504	17	Common Germline	f

Patient one, 26 yrs old, had been treated with the CHOP-15 chemotherapy regimen, then salvage chemotherapy to prepare for autologous bone marrow transplant but ultimately relapsed. After initiation of crizotinib, PET, CT and bone marrow aspirates showed complete remission of previous lesions at 28 days. At time of publication the patient continued to show persistent response at 6 months. A 20 year old patient relapsed after one month of CHOP, and was treated with further chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation resulting in partial response of 1 month. Crizotinib was initialized, and after 12 days PET scan showed complete regression of all lesions. On day 60 bone marrow aspirates were ALK-negative (pretreatment evaluation showed 8% ALK-positive).

HCC78CR1, 2, and 3 cells and Ba/F3 cells transfected with CD74–ROS1 L2155S, showed resistance to crizotinib compared with parental HCC78 and Ba/F3 cells. In addition, these cell lines showed resistance to foretinib, a potent ROS1 inhibitor that is effective against ROS1 G2032R-mutant cells (16), and TAE684, a potent ALK inhibitor	25688157	PubMed	Song et al., 2015, Clin.

The patient had been heavily treated with chemotherapy before establishment of the cell line. The cell line maintained the tumor immunophenotype.  SNP analysis of patient bone marrow mononuclear cells and LM1 showed chromosomal changes associated with the cell line but 94.7% of SNPs were identically called.  ALK kinase inhibitor TAE684 induced cell death in LM1 cells at low nanomolar concentrations, while it did not significantly effect the ALK-rearrangement negative DLBCL cell line Karpas422.  LM1 cells formed tumors in 3/10 SCID and 9/10 NOD-SCID mice.  CD30 and CD138 immmunostaining were maintained between original tumor and LM1 xenografts. In mice, LM1 but not Karpas422 xenografts regressed with TAE684 administration, and complete remission for 13 weeks was observed before experiment was terminated.	21494621	PubMed	Cerchietti et al., 2011, PLoS ONE	4.0	accepted	520	17	Somatic	f

1263	238	Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma	50745.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Supports	C	Poor Outcome	CLTC-ALK is one of the most common ALK fusions found in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In a retrospective study of 38 patients with ALK-rearranged DLBCL, 3 were CD20 positive. Only one showed cytoplasmic, nuclear and nucleolar staining associated with NPM-ALK, while the others showed granular cytoplasmic ALK stain characteristic for CLTC-ALK.  Seven molecularly characterized cases were positive for CLTC-ALK.  6/7 patients were treated with CHOP chemotherapy with survival of 5, 10, 26 and 27 months, and two alive at end of study, and one CD20 positive patient was treated with CHOP chemotherapy supplemented with CD20-targeted rituximab, with survival of 8 months, resulting in median survival of 26 months for this group.  Although these numbers are not sufficient for statistical comparison, they compare unfavorably to 3.1 year overall survival and 45% 5 year survival of CHOP treated DLBCL patients, and even less favorably to R-CHOP standard of care for CD20 positive DLBCL, suggesting poor prognosis for CLTC-ALK DLBCL and need for updated treatment in this cohort.	19636007	PubMed	Laurent et al., 2009, J.

ALK rearrangement was determined by FISH, but the ALK fusion partner was not determined due to limited tissue. The patient underwent treatment with CHOP chemotherapy regimen and radiation but did not respond. The patient progressed following salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Crizotinib was then administered at 250 mg twice daily, and LDH levels rapidly dropped along with disappearance of palpable lymphadenopathy, but progression ensued after 21 days and the patient died soon after. The authors attribute the short response to crizotinib to the possibility of this tumor having an ALK fusion variant less responsive to ALK inhibition and to a high Ki-67 index in the patient, and deem that despite the brief response, crizotinib shows promise in ALK rearranged DLBCL.	24330038	PubMed	Wass et al., 2014, Eur.

Histopathological analysis showed diffuse tumor cell infiltrate (CD20/EMA negative) with cytoplasmic ALK. RT-PCR indicated CLTC-ALK fusion. The patient was diagnosed with splenic ALK + diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Stage III, Group A with an IPI of 3. CHOP-21 chemotherapy regimen was administered with improvement in abdominal lymph nodes but worsening in retroperitoneal lymph nodes assessed via standardized uptake values. Subsequent ICE chemotherapy regiment relieved some symptoms prompting the patient to refuse further treatment despite other indications of disease progression. Therapy was reinstated after worsening of disease. GEMOX chemotherapy was administered with dexamethasone and 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulting in symptom relief, decreased lymphadenopathy and LDH decline. The disease then progressed and the patient died 2 months after crizotinib initiation. The authors conclude that partial response to crizotinib was observed and that in future trials ALK rearranged DLBCL patients might see increased benefit with earlier application of targeted therapy during the treatment course.	26221234	PubMed	Li et al., 2015, Int J Clin Exp Med	3.0	accepted	520	17	Somatic	f

ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.	23639470	PubMed	Seto et al., 2013, Lancet Oncol.	3.0	accepted	499	2	Somatic	f

DUX4, ZNF384 and MEF2D fusions were the most frequent found.  DUX4 fusions were found only in AYA cases (age 15-39) and this was significant, p=0.016. DUX4 fusions clustered into groups distinct from the other fusions, and these fusions as a whole clustered with Ph- ALL cases. The authors performed extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments to demonstrate that DUX4 fusions are likely early initiating/events and that DUX4 fusion and not DUX4 wild type are tumorigenic.

A V1180L missense mutation was found in the kinase domain of ALK in H3122 CHR-A1 cells. Both H3122 and H3122 CHR-A1 cells were highly and equally sensitive to ceritinib induced death. In Ba/F3 cells, ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered cells significantly more sensitive to ceritinib than Ba/F3 containing EML4-ALK I1171T mutant (alectinib and crizotinib resistant) or EML4-ALK wt.	25228534	PubMed	Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

1290	238	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908.0	None	TAE684	None	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	The V1180L mutation in the kinase domain of rearranged ALK was found in an alectinib resistant cell line named H3122 CHR-A1, which was derived from the alectinib sensitive EML4-ALK variant 1 containing NSCLC cell line H3122 by passaging into higher concentrations of alectinib. This cell line is a model for gain of alectinib resistance, and also shows resistance to crizotinib. On the other hand, the often used tool ALK inhibitor TAE684 was highly effective in killing H3122 CHR-A1, where H3122 cells were only slightly more sensitized to TAE684-induced cell death. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L in Ba/F3 cells caused IL3 independent growth as well as marked sensitization to TAE684, to a level greater than that seen in EML4-ALK I1171T (alectinib resistance mutation) or EML4-ALK wt, and over 1000x greater sensitivity than unaltered Ba/F3 + IL3.	25228534	PubMed	Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

EML4-ALK V1180L and EML4-ALK wild-type were ectopically expressed in Ba/F3 cells, and brigatinib showed strong activity against both variants. The IC50 for brigatinib against EML4-ALK wild-type was 0.95, which is about 3x higher than the IC50 that was observed for alectinib, but about 6x lower than that for crizotinib. In contrast, the IC50 for brigatinib against the alectinib resistance variant EML4-ALK V1180L was 0.49, indicating increased sensitivity to brigatinib over non mutant EML4-ALK.	25228534	PubMed	Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

Break apart FISH assay, which does not distinguish ROS1-fusion partner, was used on the tissue microarray to determine ROS1 fusion status. 2 cases of ROS1 fusions were found. 1 case was verified by RT-PCR to be a SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion, but this case was also positive for BRAF V600E.  The second case of ROS1 fusion was of undetermined fusion partner, where known ROS1 fusion parters SLC34A2, CD74 and SDC4 were tested.

AZD3463 inhibited Akt signaling in these cells within two hours of treatment, and activated apoptosis and autophagy pathways. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells implanted into left kidneys of nude mice resulted in almost complete tumor regression.	26786851	PubMed	Wang et al., 2016, Sci Rep	3.0	accepted	8	2	Somatic	f
1328	4613	Neuroblastoma	769.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Supports	A	Poor Outcome	In a cohort of 1596 diagnostic tumor samples taken from patients enrolled in the Children's oncology group (COG) neuroblastoma biology protocol ANBL00B1, 1579 samples were annotated with MYCN amplification status. 1239 (78%) were not MYCN amplified, and 349 (22%) were MYCN amplified. Five year event free survival was 74 +/- 1.6 months in non MYCN amplified cases and 39 +/- 4.1 months in amplified cases. Differences were significant with p<0.0001. Five year overall survival was 83 +/- 1.4 months and non MYCN amplified cases and 46 +/- 4.2 months in amplified cases, with p<0.0001, indicating poor prognosis for MYCN amplified cases.	25517749	PubMed	Bresler et al., 2014, Cancer Cell	4.0	accepted	298	2	Somatic	f
1329	238	Neuroblastoma	769.0	None	Lorlatinib	None	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Efficacy of the second generation ALK inhibitor PF-06463922 was tested on ALK mutation F1174L containing neuroblastoma-derived cells.  COG-N-453x and SH-SY5Y xenografts showed some inhibition when treated with crizotinib, but showed complete growth inhibition with PF-06463922 treatment.  This corresponded to 0% event free survival (EFS) in these mice by 6 weeks with crizotinib treatment, but 100% EFS with PF-06463922 treatment. Comparison of crizotinib and PF-06463922 growth inhibition in F1174L cells SH-SY5Y, NBSD 415-IMDM and KELLY showed increased sensitivity to PF-06463922, as compared to crizotinib. Inhibition effects were not seen on neuroblastoma cells with wild type ALK (NB-EBc1, SK-N-BE(2)C). Decreased phosphorylation on ALK tyrosine 1278 was seen with PF-06463922 over crizotinib at 10 and 100 nM concentrations in SH-SY5Y cells. PF-06463922 was well tolerated in the in-vivo models.	26554404	PubMed	Infarinato et al., 2016, Cancer Discov	4.0	accepted	8	2	Somatic	f

In contrast, PF-06463922 treatment induced complete tumor regression and EFS rate of 100% at six weeks.  PF-06463922 inhibited viability in Felix cells at 37x efficacy over crizotinib, with IC50 values of 21.8 +/- 0.4 and 814.0 +/- 119 respectively.

ALK wild-type neuroblastoma cell lines did not show differential sensitivity to the treatments within the sensitivity range of R1275Q cells, and had IC50 values above 3800 nM to the inhibitors. NB-1653 cells induced tumors in CB17 SCID mice and crizotinib treatment inhibited tumor growth over vehicle treatment, but PF-06463922 induced complete tumor regression.	26554404	PubMed	Infarinato et al., 2016, Cancer Discov	4.0	accepted	9	2	Somatic	f

Brigatinib treatment of CLB-BAR cells reduced MYCN protein levels and ALK phosphorylation (Y1604) similar to crizotnib. Brigatinib reduced CLB-BAR cellular proliferation more effectively than crizotinib (IC50 75.2 vs 186.4nM). CLB-BAR xenografts in BalbC/NUDE mice responded to brigatinib with reduced tumor volume and weight (N=8/group) as well as reduced ALK phosphorylation and MYCN levels compared to untreated controls.

Cells were subsequently cultured in 96 well plates at increasing concentrations of crizotinib (250, 500, 720, 1000, 1440 and 2000 nM). Cell growth occurred in all wells at 250 nM, and was absent at 2000 nM. From 500 through 1440 nM there were progressively fewer resistant clones present. 422 mutations representing 16 different sites were identified. EML4-ALK F1245C was found at 500 nM crizotinib, and was among the 10 most frequently observed mutations. Ba/F3 cells with unaltered EML4-ALK had crizotinib IC50 values for viability of 132 +/- 45 nM. EML4-ALK F1245C clones from the selection assay had IC50 viability value of 425 +/- 100 nM, while Ba/F3 cells expressing reintroduced EML4-ALK F1245C had IC50 value of 269 +/- 194 nM.	22034911	PubMed	Zhang et al., 2011, Chem Biol Drug Des	2.0	accepted	551	2	Somatic	f

He tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break apart FISH assay, and started crizotinib with near complete response for 27 months. Progression then occurred and biopsy of a pleural nodule was performed with hybrid-capture NGS. EML4-ALK variant 3 with F1245C mutation was found with allele frequency of 2% and tumor purity 13%. Due to slow progression and low tumor burden crizotinib was maintained for additional 8 months, and then he was transitioned onto ceritinib at 750 mg daily. After 3 months ceritinib, complete radiographic response was seen and the patient was without evidence of disease at 6 months. Dose was reduced to 600 mg ceritinib daily due to gastrointestinal side effects.	26775591	PubMed	Kodityal et al., 2016, Lung Cancer	3.0	accepted	551	2	Somatic	f

Upon disease progression, the initial diagnostic biopsy tested positive for ALK-rearrangement using break apart FISH, but the ALK fusion was not sequenced for mutations. Break-apart signal was positive in 66% of tumor cells. Crizotinib was initiated and a sustained near complete response for 27 months was observed, after which an FDG-avid cervical lymph node appeared along with pleural effusions and pleural nodules. A pleural nodule was biopsied and profiled using hybrid-capture next generation sequencing, and revealed EML4-ALK variant 3 with F1245C mutation at mutant allele frequency of 2% and tumor purity of 13%. Crizotinib was maintained for 8 additional months due to low tumor burden and slow progression.	26775591	PubMed	Kodityal et al., 2016, Lung Cancer	2.0	accepted	551	2	Somatic	f
1340	238	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908.0	None	Ceritinib	None	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Ceritinib was 28x more potent (GI50 3.8nM) than crizotinib (GI50 107nM) at inhibiting growth of  H2228, an NSCLC cell line which harbors the EML4-ALK variant 3a/3b. SCID mice xenografted with H2228 were treated for 14 days with crizotinib (100 mg/kg) or ceritinib (25 or 50 mg/kg). All treatments caused tumor regression, but tumors recurred within 11 days after crizotinib treatment withdrawal. 4/8 mice treated with 25 mg/kg ceritinib showed regrowth after 1 month treatment withdrawal. The remaining 4/8 mice treated at 25 mg/kg ceritinib, and all mice treated at 50 mg/kg ceritinib maintained complete remission for four months. While 100 mg/kg crizotinib in mice approximates levels 3-5 times the maximal tolerated dose in humans, the authors state 25 to 50 mg/kg ceritinib in mice is predicted to approximate tolerable doses in humans.	24675041	PubMed	Friboulet et al., 2014, Cancer Discov	3.0	accepted	503	2	Somatic	f

In nude mice with MGH045 xenografts, tumor response to crizotinib did not differ appreciably from vehicle, while ceritinib controlled tumor growth. Ceritinib inhibited Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK L1196M slightly stronger than ALK wild-type, but approximately double the potency as crizotinib, indicating ceritinib sensitivity in Ba/F3 EML4-ALK L1196M cells.	24675041	PubMed	Friboulet et al., 2014, Cancer Discov	4.0	accepted	7	2	Somatic	f

Tumors from mice with EML4-ALK variant 3 H2228 NSCLC cell xenografts which had progressed after approximately 40 days of crizotinib treatment were sequenced for ALK mutations. I1171T was found as one of 6 ALK resistance mutations from 80 sequenced tumors.

EML4-ALK variant 3 NSCLC cell line H2228 was used in SCID mouse xenografts which were exposed to increasing crizotinib up to 100 mg/kg. Within 40 days tumors progressed, and progressed tumors were assayed for ALK mutation. Of 80 tumors, 6 had ALK mutation and 3 of these were G1202R.

The authors considered a fold difference of 4 to 10 between the alectinib-sensitized wild-type and mutant variant to indicate a resistant mutant variant. In the background of the NPM-ALK fusion, IC50 for G1269A mutation was 104 nM, which was 5.3 fold that reported for NPM-ALK wild-type. Western blots of alectinib treated NPM-ALK G1269A were performed and reduced pALK Y1604 was seen at 300 nM alectinib, and no pALK at 1000 nM.

Methylome analysis revealed three CpG clusters (C1–3) with differential methylation to be negatively correlated with differential c-MET mRNA expression. In nearly all (90%) pairwise comparisons of tumors and cell lines, differential c-MET mRNA expression could be accounted for by at least one differential CpG cluster methylation (Δβ ≥ 10% and FDR adjusted p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, only 48% displayed a concordant differential expression pattern of at least one c-MET transcription factor. In an independent study, c-MET was overexpressed in 8 of 35 (23%) MAPKi-resistant tumors from 7 of 26 (27%) patients.

Copy number profiling from exome sequencing of MCF-7 and MCF-7pR, confirmed relative amplification of CCNE1. Silencing of CCNE1 or CDK2 alone in MCF-7pR cells had no effect on cell-cycle arrest, but resulted in substantially increased cell-cycle arrest and reduction in cell growth in combination with palbociclib.	27020857	PubMed	Herrera-Abreu et al., 2016, Cancer Res.	3.0	accepted	187	19	None	f

1632	55294	Cancer	162.0	None	Sirolimus	None	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	FBXW7 was shown to target mTOR for ubiquitination and degradation.  A reciprocal relationship between FBXW7 or PTEN loss was identified in breast cancer tumors and cell lines (mutual exclusivity of these two events).  In total only 4 out of 450 tumor and cell line samples had concomitant loss of both genes (p=4.9x10^-7). Cell lines (n=5) with FBXW7 mutations or deletions were significantly sensitive to rapamycin and downregulation of FBXW7 (shRNA) increased the sensitivity to rapamycin. In summary, this evidence suggests that FBXW7 may be a biomarker for cancers sensitivity to inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.	18787170	PubMed	Mao et al., 2008, Science	4.0	accepted	637	4	Somatic	f

1710	6663	Melanoma	1909.0	None	Vemurafenib	None	Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	FACS-assisted shRNA genetic screen identified SOX10 as a determinant of vemurafenib resistance. Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-β signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB. EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation of melanoma cells in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Melanoma cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are enriched in the presence of vemurafenib. This study finds evidence for SOX10 loss (N=2) and/or activation of TGF-β signalling (N=2) in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples.	24670642	PubMed	Sun et al., 2014, Nature	4.0	accepted	672	22	None	f

Removing FL or FGF2 from ligand-dependent resistant cultures transiently restored sensitivity to AC220, but accelerated acquisition of secondary resistance mutations. 10 FLT3-ITD AML patients treated with AC220 developed increased FGF2 expression (IHC) in marrow stromal cells, which peaked prior to overt clinical relapse and detection of resistance mutations	27671675	PubMed	Traer et al., 2016, Cancer Res.	4.0	accepted	673	4	None	f

R173C resides in the NH2-terminal phosphatase domain of PTEN. R173C was one of four mutations (out of 42 tested) that displayed no significant phosphatase activity against either substrate, indicating, by this assay, that the mutation negatively impacts the function of PTEN.   However this mutation did not affect the ability of PTEN to bind lipid membranes in-vivo.

None of the 84 panitumumab-treated patients with KRAS mutant tumors responded to treatment (100% positive predictive value for nonresponse in mutant group). In the KRAS wt group treated with panitumumab (n=124), 21 patients had partial response (17%), 42 experienced stable disease (34%). Additionally, patients with KRAS mutations showed no significant improvement between treatment with panitumumab and BSC alone (PFS: 7.4 wk vs 7.3 wk).

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. MDA-MB-361 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA E545K, and it had an IC50 of 0.14uM. To asses the effect of pictilisib on cell cycle progression and apoptosis, fluorescence based cell cycle and flow cytometry were used to measure the proportion of cells in various phases and the relative presence of Annexin V, a marker of apoptosis. Untreated, 68% of cells were in G1 or sub-G1. Following treatment with 1.0uM pictilisib, the proportion of cells in G1 or sub-G1 rose to 78%, and the amount of Annexin V detected rose 3 fold. A substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT (S473) was also noted. Authors concluded that pictilisib had a modest effect on cell cycle progression and encouraged apoptosis in this cell line, and that this cell line is sensitive to pictilisib. Authors further noted that HER2 amplified cell lines were generally more sensitive, regardless of mutation, to pictilisib than basal-like breast cancer cell lines (p=0.002).	20453058	PubMed	O'Brien et al., 2010, Clin.

The authors tested several basal and luminal cell lines harboring PTEN loss for sensitivity to GDC-0941. ZR-75-1, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.15uM and reduction in phosphorylated AKT was noted following administration of GDC-0941. EVSTA-T, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.36uM; treatment resulted in an relative increase of Sub-G and G phase cells from 49% to 78% of total cells evaluated; there was a 12fold increase in annexin V (an apoptotic marker), and a substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT following GDC-0941 administration. Seven basal-like cell lines harbored PTEN loss and had IC50s ranging fom 0.30uM to 20.00uM (4/7 had IC50s greater than 1 uM). There was a varied reduction in phosphorylated AKT among basal-like cell lines. Authors note that PTEN status may have low predictive power for response, and suggested that other factors such as basal/luminal characteristics may be more informative for GDC-0941 response.

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. KPL4 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA H1047R, and it had an IC50 of 0.28uM. To evaluate in vivo efficacy, cells were injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice, and allowed to grow. Subsequently, pictilisib was administered orally daily for 14 days. Mice treated with 100mg/kg experienced a 76% tumor reduction, and those treated with 150mg/kg experienced a 90% tumor reduction, with respect to untreated control. Phosphorylated AKT (S473) was substantially reduced with pictilisib administration. Three other HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines harbored PIK3CA H1047R: UACC-893, HCC1954, MDA-MB-453, which had IC50s of 0.41uM, 0.49uM, and 0.64uM, suggesting that PIK3CA H1047R induces sensitivity to pictilisib in HER2 amplified breast cancer. Authors note that pictilisib was well tolerated in vivo and further note that HER2 amplified cell lines were generally more sensitive, regardless of mutation, to pictilisib than basal-like cell lines (p=0.002).	20453058	PubMed	O'Brien et al., 2010, Clin.

2097	5290	Breast Cancer	1612.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	Prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutations was evaluated in a retrospective study of 590 patients with surgically resected invasive breast cancer. Patients whose tumors harbored PIK3CA H1047R (n=88, 14.9%) experienced significantly higher 10-year overall survival rate (76% vs 62%) and lower 10-year probability of breast cancer specific death (11% vs 23%) compared to those with wildtype PIK3CA. They also experienced a 2.8 and 2 fold reduction in probability of death due to breast cancer at 5 and 10 years. Authors found that PIK3CA H1047R was specifically associated with lymph node-negative status: 64% of H1047R patients were lymph-node negative compared to 48% of patients with PIK3CA WT and helical domain mutated tumors (P=0.007). PIK3CA H1047R was positively associated with lymph node negative status, lower nodal stage, lower overall stage, and smaller tumor size compared to WT PIK3CA	19671852	PubMed	Kalinsky et al., 2009, Clin.

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. Three cell lines harbored PIK3CA H1047R. T-47D is a luminal type breast cancer cell line, and it had an IC50 of 0.22uM. Treatment with GDC-0941 resulted in a substantial reduction of phosphorylated AKT. BT-20 is a basal breast cancer cell line which had an ICD50 of 0.62uM. MFM-223 is basal cell line that had an ICD50 of 2.10uM, and experienced some reduction in pAKT. Authors note that luminal-like cell lines were generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal-like (p=0.02).	20453058	PubMed	O'Brien et al., 2010, Clin. Cancer Res.	2.0	accepted	107	3	Somatic	f

HCC1954 and KPL-4 cell lines expressing PIK3CA H1047R were associated with similar sensitivity to T-DM1 as PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3; reduced cell viability was observed at concentrations > 0.01 ug/mL in all three cell lines. Conversely, the cell lines harboring PIK3CA H1047R were resistant to trastuzumab in vitro at all concentrations tested (0-10 ug/mL). Further, treatment with T-DM1 on SCID mice xenografted with KPL-4 (PIK3CA H1047R cells) resulted in inhibition of tumor growth. A single dose of T-DM1 >5mg/kg was sufficient to induce tumor regression >20 days after administration.	26920887	PubMed	Baselga et al., 2016, Clin. Cancer Res.	3.0	accepted	107	3	Somatic	f

Tumor samples were obtained at the time of surgery and genotyped for PIK3CA exon 10 and 21 mutations (listed as exon 9 and 20 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). Of the 19 patients whose tumors harbored PIK3CA mutations, nine harbored PIK3CA E545K. PIK3CA E545K was associated with poor outcome compared to other PIK3CA mutations for local and distant recurrences (HR: 11.6, P < 0.001; HR 3.7, P = 0.006). Additionally, 89% of patients whose tumors harbored PIK3CA E545K experienced a relapse.	19903786	PubMed	He et al., 2009, Clin. Cancer Res.	2.0	accepted	104	3	Somatic	f

Prior to the development of the EGFR T790M mutation, the patient was treated with gefitinib and achieved a partial response, but subsequently tumor progression occurred; however, osimertinib treatment resulted a favorable tumor response with the extinguishment of the EGFR T790M mutation. In a stage IV lung adenocarcinoma patient harboring an EGFR L858R mutation and an acquired EGFR T790M co-mutation, EGFR T790M was associated with sensitivity to osimertinib monotherapy. Prior to the development of the EGFR T790M mutation, the patient was treated with erlotinib, followed by gefitinib for 12 months and achieved stable disease, but subsequently metastasis occurred; the EGFR T790M was then identified and subsequent 10 month treatment with osimertinib monotherapy resulted in a 45% disease regression.	26269204	PubMed	Planchard et al., 2015, Ann.

Patients harboring BRAF mutations (total n=24, V600E n=23, D594G n=1) had a lower response rate than did patients with wildtype BRAF (n=326; 2/24 [4.3%] vs 124/326 [38%], OR: 0.15, p=0.0012). BRAF mutant patients also experienced significantly lower disease control rate, PFS, and OS (median 26 vs 54 weeks, HR: 3.03 p<0.0001) in response to cetuximab treatment. In multivariate analysis, the significant associations between BRAF mutations and poor outcome were confirmed. The authors noted that two responders had the following genotypes: V600E mutation in low copy number, and BRAF D594G, and suggested that mutation status of BRAF is more informative than those of NRAS and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response (second only to KRAS).	20619739	PubMed	De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.	3.0	accepted	399	7	Somatic	f

Of those, 76 patients harbored KRAS G12D, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. Five patients had partial response, 34 had stable disease, and 37 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=61), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=6), cetuximab monotherapy (n=5), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=2), cetuximab + 5FU (n=1), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + bevacizumab (n=1).

Median age was 62 years old (32-86), and there were 43 males and 33 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.	20619739	PubMed	De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.	3.0	accepted	79	12	Somatic	f

Patients with KRAS wildtype, NRAS assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=301) were genotyped for NRAS mutations. Patients harboring NRAS mutant tumors (n=13) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype NRAS (n=289; 1/13 [7.7%] vs 110/289 [77.9%]; p =.013). However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype NRAS in disease control rate, progression free survival, or overall survival. Authors note that their small sample size of patients with NRAS mutant tumors made it difficult to assess the effect of NRAS mutation on survival thus the large confidence intervals. Authors further note that the close relationship between KRAS and NRAS, and the lack of NRAS response to another EGFR inhibitor (panitumumab) support the inclusion of NRAS genotyping prior to cetuximab treatment. Authors suggest screening for mutations in the following gene order: KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA exon 21 (listed as PIK3CA exon 20 in the source).	20619739	PubMed	De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.	2.0	accepted	208	1	Somatic	f

Of patients harboring KIT exon 9 mutated GISTs, 11 (47.8%) had a partial response, 6 had stable disease, 4 had progressive disease and 2 were nonassessable. Patients with KIT exon 9 mutant GISTs were significantly more likely to have a partial response than those with WT KIT (P = .013), though significantly less likely than those with KIT exon 11 mutated GISTs (P = .0006). Patients harboring KIT exon 9 mutant GISTs experienced longer event free survival (median: 200 days) than those with WT KIT GISTs (82 days). Furthermore, there was a signficant difference in overall survival between patients with KIT exon 9 mutant and double WT kinase GISTs (P = .0067). There was no significant difference in the rate of treatment failure for patients with exon 9 mutation compared with those with no KIT or PDGFRA mutation (P = .14).	14645423	PubMed	Heinrich et al., 2003, J.

The study found that patients whose tumors harbored mutations in KIT exon 11 had signficantly superior responses to imatinib, regardless of dose,  than those whose tumors harbored wildtype KIT or KIT exon 9 mutations. This is evidenced by the findings that imatinib-treated patients whose tumors contained KIT exon 11 mutations had longer overall survival compared to those with exon 9 mutations (60.0mo vs.38.4mo, P=0.011) or wildtype KIT (60mo vs. 49.0mo, P=0.049).

Six GISTs harbored PDGFRA mutations, three of which were deemed imatinib-sensitive by the authors: 1 DIMH842-845 deletion, one I843 deletion, and one V561D point mutation. Two of these patients' GISTs experienced partial responses to imatinib and one experienced progressive disease. Overall, the partial response rate of patients with an imatinib sensitive mutation of KIT or PDGFRA was 75.7% (87 of 115 patients), whereas the partial response rate in patients with no kinase mutation or a previously described imatinib resistant mutation was 0% (0 of 12 patients). The authors concluded that PDGFRA gain-of-function mutations may account for imatinib sensivity in some WT KIT GISTs.	14645423	PubMed	Heinrich et al., 2003, J. Clin.

Bafetinib (INNO-406) and dasatinib showed drastically higher IC50 values (970.3 nM and 91nM) in K562/D1-9 than the non-resistant K562 cell line (24.7 nM and 1.5nM), suggesting resistance in the presence of ABCB1 overexpression. The authors state that Bafetinib resistance is likely attributable to it being substrates of P-glycoprotein while nilotinib, which is unlikely to be a P-glycoprotein substrate, had a smaller change in IC50 between the two cell lines. Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation using the MTT assay.	18191450	PubMed	Deguchi et al., 2008, Leuk. Res.	3.0	accepted	2915	None	Somatic	f

Three CP patients, with the M351T variants detected prior to resistance, had hematologic responses prior to progression. One patient became resistant after the appearance of the M351T variant but responded to dose escalation. The last patient, who also had the Q252H variant, progressed to myeloid blast crisis (MBC) after which there was cytogenetic evidence of a double Ph-chromosome and no detectable secondary variants. Three accelerated-phase (AP) patients returned to CP and had M351T variants. One of these patients also had E255K and F359V variants and progressed to AP. The remaining two, one of whom also had H396R variant, progressed to MBC and died. Two additional AP patients also had M351T variants but initially had CHRs. One who also had the G250E variant died from disease progression. The other also had the F359V variant progressed to MBC with cytogenetic evidence of the double Ph-chromosome and no detectable secondary variants at progression.	12623848	PubMed	Branford et al., 2003, Blood	4.0	accepted	1029	9	Somatic	f

The effect of the A2062V variant on ATM expression was tested by western blot, and the effect on ATM function was tested by treating with doxorubicin to induce double-strand breaks (DSB) and monitoring p21 induction. To confirm wild type p53, parallel cell cultures were treated with fludarabine generating single-strand breaks, in addition to DSB, and monitored for adequate p21 induction. A patient sample had the A2062V variant of ATM, confirmed by sanger sequencing, in trans with a loss of function 11q deletion found in 87% of cells by FISH. Western blot showed stable ATM expression.

Out of 40 BRCA (BRCA1 or BRCA2) mutant patients, 5 had somatic BRCA2 mutation, 4 of which were homozygous mutations and one had unknown zygosity. Confirmed objective response was seen in 80% (4/5) of the somatic BRCA2 mutant subgroup. Authors note that response rate was similar regardless of whether the BRCA mutation was somatic or germline, in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. In a BRCA wild-type subgroup, with low levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), confirmed objective response was observed in 10% (7/70) of the patients. Patients with BRCA mutant tumors experienced significantly longer median progression free survival than patients with BRCA wildtype, LOH low tumors (12.8 vs 5.2 mo, HR: 0.27, P<0.0001).	27908594	PubMed	Swisher et al., 2017, Lancet Oncol.	2.0	accepted	186	13	Somatic	f

Among patients with MGMT data available for analysis, radiotherapy was started and completed in 91% of patients with low MGMT expression. In contrast, among patients with high MGMT expression, only 64% started radiotherapy, and 43% completed it. These results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be feasible for inoperable glioblastoma patients expressing low levels of MGMT without compromising subsequent treatment with radiotherapy, whereas patients with high MGMT expression are less likely to respond and more likely to experience progression before or during radiotherapy.	17442989	PubMed	Chinot et al., 2007, J.

Because of this mutation's rarity and the variability of responses of treated cases, its exact prognostic and predictive role is not fully understood. In our experience, S768I mutations in isolation do not necessarily confer sensitivity to erlotinib, but in conjunction with sensitizing EGFR mutations, S768I mutations do not restrict efficacy.	27211795	PubMed	Leventakos et al., 2016, J Thorac Oncol	2.0	accepted	562	7	Somatic	f

2913	5979	Thyroid Gland Medullary Carcinoma	3973.0	None	None	None	Predisposing	Supports	B	Pathogenic	Study of a family with three generations of history indicating co-segregation of RET C609Y and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, many of whom exhibited medullary thyroid cancers specifically.  22 individuals in this family were carriers of C609Y. Of these, 9 exhibited medullary thyroid cancers. While the variant is strongly suspected of being pathogenic for these tumors, this variant appears to result in later onset of cancer than some other variants and the authors recommend delaying prophylactic thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age. In addition to this large family, the authors also provide an extensive review of prior reports of C609 variants, identifying a total of 111 patients from 19 publications, representing 21 affected kindreds and 15 sporadic cases. 89 of these cases had C609Y specifically.  The authors also summarize prior functional work that suggests that C609Y has transforming activity that is significant but not as strong as some other variants. Based on all of this analysis, the authors conclude that C609Y causes medullary thyroid cancers but a milder form than some other variants. Based on this paper, the following ACMG evidence codes seem potentially valid: 'PS1', 'PS3',  'PM5', 'PP1', 'PP4', and 'PP5'.	19472011	PubMed	Calva et al., 2009, Ann. Surg.

In patients with AKT1 E17K-mutant tumors (n = 52) and a median of 5 lines of prior therapy, the median PFS was 5.5 months , 6.6 months and 4.2 months in patients with ER+ breast, gynecologic, and other solid tumors, respectively. In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations. Persistent declines in AKT1 E17K in cfDNA were associated with improved PFS and response.

Beta-Catenin deregulation has been commonly identified in sporadic desmoids. CTNNB1 mutations were observed in 117 of 138 (85%) of desmoids. Three discrete mutations in two codons of CTNNB1 exon 3 were identified: T41A (59%), S45F (33%), and S45P (8%). Five-year recurrence-free survival was significantly poorer in S45F-mutated desmoids (23%, P < 0.0001) versus either T41A (57%) or nonmutated tumors (65%). Because of their low frequency, patients with S45P mutations were excluded from these analyses but showed a recurrence course similar to T41A or wild type patients.	18832571	PubMed	Lazar et al., 2008, Am.

PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of patients via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples. Of patients with PIK3CA mutations, 39% (73/189) had mutations in exon 21 (listed as exon 20 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). The presence of an exon 21 mutation was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer-specific or overall survival when compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (multivariate, stage-stratified HR = 1.11 vs 1). Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed	Liao et al., 2012, Clin. Cancer Res.	2.0	accepted	105	3	Somatic	f

Patients with KRAS wildtype, PIK3CA assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=339) were genotyped for PIK3CA mutations. Patients harboring PIK3CA mutant tumors (n=34) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype PIK3CA (6/34 [17.7%] vs 115/305 [37.7%]; p =.015). Patients with mutant PIK3CA also experienced lower disease control rate in response to cetuximab treatment. However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype PIK3CA in progression free or overall survival (median PFS: 18 vs 24 weeks; median OS: 39 vs 51 weeks). Authors suggest that PIK3CA exon 21 mutations are more relevant to cetuximab response than PIK3CA mutations as a whole, as PIK3CA exon 10 mutations do not appear to effect cetuximab response (exons are listed as exon 20 and exon 9 in the source).	20619739	PubMed	De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.	2.0	accepted	311	3	Somatic	f

No statistically significant improvement in PFS was seen with erlotinib in the KRAS mutant group over placebo. Significant difference in PFS between erlotinib treated KRAS WT and MUT patients was not seen.  Overall, in the intent to treat population erlotinib significantly improved PFS over placebo (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82; P<0.001).	21969500	PubMed	Brugger et al., 2011, J. Clin.

Patients harboring KRAS codon 61 mutations (n=13) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with KRAS wildtype tumors (0/13 vs 123/345; p= .0055). Authors consider KRAS codon 61 mutations as supporting resistance to cetuximab and suggest that it should be included in KRAS mutation screening. Authors note that these patients were treated with cetuximab prior to widespread adoption of regular KRAS mutational status screening. Patients treated with cetuximab monotherapy were not included.	20619739	PubMed	De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.	4.0	accepted	203	12	Somatic	f

Of those, 16 patients harbored KRAS G12C, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. One patient had a partial response, 6 had stable disease, and 9 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=15) and cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=1). Median PFS was 11 weeks (6-65 weeks), median OS was 24 weeks (14-91 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (1-6). Median age was 62 years old (46-73), and there were 8 males and 8 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.	20619739	PubMed	De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.	3.0	accepted	78	12	Somatic	f

Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. In vivo, KRAS G12C expressing SW48 cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Treatment with regorafenib did not lead to a significant delay of tumor growth. Mice injected with KRAS wt cells did not significantly respond to regorafenib, although a trend was seen toward better response. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed no significant change in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31) and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS G12C expressing mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS wt expressing mice whose tumors displayed more pronounced changes. Authors concluded that G12C was more resistant to regorafenib than KRAS wt and other common KRAS G12/G13 mutants.	26161928	PubMed	Camaj et al., 2015, Future Oncol	2.0	accepted	78	12	Somatic	f

Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.	17877814	PubMed	de Gunst et al., 2007, Mol. Cancer	3.0	accepted	33	7	Somatic	f

One patient was biopsied twice following crizotinib progression and once pre-treatment. This patient was a 27 year old female with one pack year who experienced partial response on crizotinib as 4th line therapy. The patient's pre-crizotinib biopsy was ALK+ and lacked the EGFR mutation. A biopsy taken after 63 days on crizotinib showed EGFR L858R mutation and lacked ALK gene rearrangement by FISH (ALK Loss). Of note, a second post-treatment biopsy (after 113 on crizotinib) showed ALK rearrangement but lacked EGFR mutation. The authors interpreted the emergence of an ALK negative tumor (first post-critozitinib biopsy) as evidence of a separate oncogenic driver (EGFR L858R).	22235099	PubMed	Doebele et al., 2012, Clin.

Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=5), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=1), and cetuximab monotherapy (n=1). Median PFS was 34 weeks (17-48 weeks), median OS was 46 weeks (27-91 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 59 years old (53-74), and there were 6 females and one male. Using these and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that PIK3CA exon 10 (listed as exon 9 in source) mutations are associated with weak or no resistance to cetuximab.	20619739	PubMed	De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.	3.0	accepted	103	3	Somatic	f
4429	3845	Colorectal Cancer	9256.0	None	Cetuximab	None	Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Of those, 22 patients harbored KRAS G12A, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. Three patients had partial response, 12 had stable disease, and seven progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=18), cetuximab monotherapy (n=1), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=2), and cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=1). Median PFS was 18 weeks (1-34 weeks), median OS was 35 weeks (1-143 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-5). Median age was 62 years old (22-77) and there were 11 males and 11 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.	20619739	PubMed	De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.	3.0	accepted	148	12	Somatic	f

The cells were tested for Regorafenib resistance. Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558/T670I mutations (IC50 = 132 +- 25 nM) did show resistance towards  Regorafenib  compared to Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558 alone (IC50 = 30 +- 14 nM). In addition, Ba/F3 cells were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and incubated with varying concentrations of Regorafenib. In Regorafenib incubated cells, T670I mutations were seen in approximately 10% of the resistant cell populations. The results suggest that T670I does induce regorafenib resistance in del 557-558/T670I cells.	25239608	PubMed	Garner et al., 2014, Clin. Cancer Res.	4.0	accepted	1267	4	Somatic	f

Tumor tissue for mutational status assessment was obtained from 230 patients on one or more occassions (pre-imatinib, post-imatinib/pre-sunitinib, post-sunitinib). Tissue was assessed for mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and in PDGFRA exons 12 and 18.  With sunitinib treatment, patients with a primary (pre-imatinib) KIT exon 9 mutation (n=42) displayed significantly better PFS compared with those with a primary KIT exon 11 mutation (n=143; p = .011),  significantly longer OS (p =.002), and significantly higher ORR (p=.012).

4631	3815	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	9253.0	None	Imatinib,Sunitinib	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	Several preclinical studies were done in order to test the effects of various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on KIT-mutant cell lines derived from Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) patients with primary mutation 560-578 deletion and secondary mutation D816E. The cells were tested for Imatinib and Sunitinib resistances. GIST-T1/816 cells with 560-578 deletion and D816E mutations were resistant towards Imatinib and Sunitinib (Imatinib IC50: 604 nM and Sunitinib IC50: 3111 nM) compared to GIST-T1 cells with the 560-578 deletion mutation alone (Imatinib IC50: 30 nM and Sunitinib IC50: 15 nM). Imatinib inhibited phosphorylation in KIT and ERK at high concentrations. Sunitinib did not inhibit phosphorylation in KIT, ERK, or AKT at all. Additionally, Ba/F3 cells were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and incubated with varying concentrations of Sunitinib and Imatinib separately. In Imatinib incubated cells, D816E mutations were seen in less than 5% of resistant Ba/F3 cell clones only in the lowest concentration. In Imatinib incubated cells, D816E mutations were seen in approximately 10% of resistant Ba/F3 cell clones.	25239608	PubMed	Garner et al., 2014, Clin. Cancer Res.	4.0	accepted	1559	4	Somatic	f

Of the 42 patients treated with trametinib/pemetrexed, 14% (6/42) had a PR; the ORR was 17% (4/23) in KRAS-mutated NSCLC versus 11% (2/19) in KRAS wild-type NSCLC.	27876675	PubMed	Gandara et al., 2017, J Thorac Oncol	3.0	accepted	336	12	Somatic	f
4863	3845	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908.0	None	Nivolumab,Atezolizumab	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	A meta-analysis of randomized trials to investigate if KRAS mutation status affects survival benefits of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in patients with advanced NSCLC. Of 3 eligible studies using either nivolumab or atezolizumab, 138 patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC and 371 with KRAS wild-type were included. ICI improved overall survival over that with docetaxel in KRAS mutant, previously-treated advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio=0.64 [95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.96], P = 0.03) but not in those with KRAS wild-type tumor (HR = 0.88 [95% CI, 0.68-1.13], P = 0.30). These results suggest that KRAS mutation status may be a potential biomarker for survival benefits to ICIs.	28525386	PubMed	Kim et al., 2017, Oncotarget	3.0	accepted	336	12	Somatic	f

KRAS-mutant tumors were marginally more likely to be PD-L1 positive than KRAS-wild type tumors (51% vs 36%; odds ratio: 1.69; 95% CI 1.01-2.84; p = 0.045). Authors concluded that this result contributes to a theoretical basis for including PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with other molecularly targeted drugs in the treatment of patients with KRAS mutations.	28259530	PubMed	Li et al., 2017, Eur J Surg Oncol	2.0	accepted	336	12	Somatic	f

Median PFS was 12 weeks in the trametinib arm and 11 weeks in the docetaxel arm (HR 1.14; p = 0.5197). Median OS, while the data are immature, was 8 months in the trametinib arm and was not reached in the docetaxel arm (HR 0.97; P = 0.934). There were 10 (12%) partial responses (PRs) in the trametinib arm and 5 (12%) PRs in the docetaxel arm (P = 1.0000). These data suggest that trametinib is associated with similar PFS and response rates as docetaxel.	25722381	PubMed	Blumenschein et al., 2015, Ann. Oncol.	4.0	accepted	336	12	Somatic	f

The primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) for the KRAS wild-type cohort and objective response rate (ORR) for the KRAS mutant cohort. Median PFS in the KRAS wild-type arm was 2.4 months for erlotinib alone and 2.1 months for the combination. The ORR in the KRAS mutant group was 0% for selumetinib alone and 10% for the combination.

PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of cased via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples, of these 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10, 39% (73/189) had mutations in exon 21, and 3.7% (7/189) had mutations in both exons. Study found that exon 10 + exon 21 mutants were associated with shorter cancer specific survival and overall survival when compared to WT PIK3CA (P = 0.031, P = 0.0008). These mutants were also associated with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) = 3.51, multivariate HR 2.68). In contrast, mutations on either exon 10 or exon 21 alone were not statistically significant in terms of overall survival. Note that exons 10 and 21 are listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1. Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed	Liao et al., 2012, Clin.

Of those 28, 14 patients had a low RRM1 expression and 14 had a high RRM1 expression. Only the patients with low RRM1 expression received a significant benefit from gemcitabine (p=0.0010) whereas the benefit for those with a high RRM1 expression was not significantly better (p=0.3309).  The study also tested the role of ERCC1 expression and its correlation to RRM1 expression. It was found that patients with a combined high RRM1 and ERCC1 expression had good prognosis with the highest survival rate (P=0.0127).	19543324	PubMed	Akita et al., 2009, Oncogene	3.0	accepted	1257	11	None	f

Analysis for identifying genetic alterations relating to gemcitabine resistance revealed that RRM1 was the most upregulated gene with a 4.5 fold expression. RRM1-speciﬁc RNAi transfection significantly reduced the gemcitabine chemoresistance of MiaPaCa2-RG to the same level as that of gemcitabine sensitive MiaPaCa2. Moreover, gemcitabine response of MiaPaCa2 also became more sensitive.  Next, patients with pancreatic cancer were recruited and 18 tissue samples were taken. The patients with a low RRM1 expression had a significantly better outcome after gemcitabine treatment than those patients with high RRM1 expression (P=0.016).	17131328	PubMed	Nakahira et al., 2007, Int.

5675	8289	Stomach Cancer	10534.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Supports	D	Poor Outcome	In this study, real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays were used in 66 pairs of cancerous and matched adjacent normal tissues. In 43 of those pairs, the expression level of ARID1A was significantly lower in the cancerous tissue than in the normal tissue (P=0.0029). This was then again tested using Western Blotting. Consistent with the real-time PCR results, there was a lower expression of ARID1A in 13 of the tumor tissue samples compared to the normal tissue samples (P=0.0015). In an immunohistochemical analysis of 224 tissue blocks, 115 of those had a decreased ARID1A expression. The data conveyed that lower ARID1A expression was correlated with depth of tumor infiltration (P=0.001). Lastly, cell proliferation in regards to ARID1A expression was tested in cell lines. The cells with silenced expression of ARID1A had a much greater growth than those with greater expression of the protein.	22808142	PubMed	Wang et al., 2012, PLoS ONE	4.0	accepted	2108	1	None	f
5676	8289	Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma	4467.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study included 290 patients with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma whose tumor tissues were sampled and then analyzed. These samples were then divided according to ARID1A expression after immunohistochemical staining. Of the 290 patients, 213 had a low ARID1A expression and 77 patients had a high expression. Low ARID1A expression was associated with higher nuclear grade (P<0.001), advanced pTNM stage (P=0.013), shorter cancer-specific survival (p=0.001) and progression-free survival (P<0.001). After a multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards, it was found that ARID1A expression levels are an independent predictor of progression-free survival in patients with CCRCC, although no significant correlation was found between the expression levels and cancer-specific survival.	25628030	PubMed	Park et al., 2015, Hum.

A clinical presentation of VHL type 2B was noted. Genetic testing was performed on 17 family members. 11 members with the mutation had manifestations, while 6 members with the mutation were asymptomatic. 1 of the asymptomatic individuals belonged to generation 2, while the remaining 5 belonged to the fourth generation, suggesting they may be too young to present manifestations. From the members that had manifestations: 9 had pheochromocytoma (5 bilateral),  1 had lumbar spine hemangioblastoma, 1 had retinal hemangioblastoma, 4 had renal cell carcinoma (2 bilateral), and 3 had pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (1 also had a serous cystadenoma in addition to the neuroendocrine tumour). ACMG evidence codes: 'PP1' because of segregation results, 'PP2' because there is a missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and in which missense variants are a common mechanism of disease, 'PP4' because the patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

Total 207 patients could be assessed for HER2 expression. From the 23 patient with IHC 3+ HER2 expression or IHC 2+ and HER2 gene amplification, 17 patients were included in the study and could be assessed for response to the treatment. Contrary to breast and gastric cancer, only 7 out of 11 (64%) patients with IHC 3+ HER2 expression showed gene amplification. PFS rate at 12 weeks was estimated as 23.5%. Median PFS was 65 days. Median OS was 6.9 months. Authors concluded not to recommend further evaluation of anti-HER2 treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.	22374460	PubMed	Harder et al., 2012, Br. J.

Osimertinib failed to induce substantial reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2 in NR6 mouse fibroblast cells transduced to co-express ERBB2 L869R and T798I or ERBB2 wt. AZ5104 blocked phosphorylation to a greater extent in the mutant and wildtype cells. MCF10A cells transduced with ERBB2 wt, ERBB2 T798I alone or ERBB2 L869R and T798I co-expressed did not show substantial reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2, AKT, ERK or S6. AZ5104 induced greater reductions. Authors note that AZ5104 is not being developed independently of osimertinib and only 10% of osimertinib is metabolized into AZ5104 in humans.

Patients were pretreated with at least one chemotherapy regimen, but no tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the subgroup of 156 patients with exon 19 deletions as their sole EGFR mutation, 83 and 78 were treated with erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively. Objective response (defined as complete + partial response) was approximately 65 percent for both erlotinib gefitinib and non significantly different  (p= .965). Disease control rate (defined as complete response + partial response + stable disease) was 91.6 and 83.3 percent for erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively (p=.113). The study was unable to demonstrate statistical noninferiority via the planned end point; however, the lack of statistically significant differences between erlotinib and gefitinib responses, and the milder adverse effects experienced by gefitinib treated patients, led the authors to conclude that gefitinib is a feasible alternative to erlotinib in treating patients with ex19del EGFR positive, advanced lung adenocarcinoma.	27022112	PubMed	Urata et al., 2016, J.

Of those patients, 12 received six courses of chemotherapy composed of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin (or epirubicin), and cyclophosphamide. This treatment group represented patients with the following mutations (number of patients in parentheses): E545K (7), E542K (1), and H1047R (4). The other 11 patients received 12 weekly courses of paclitaxel followed by four courses of the chemotherapy described above. This treatment group represented patients with the following mutations: E545K (1), Q546R (1), E542K (1), E542V (1), H1047R (5), G1049R (1), H1047T (1). The study did not find evidence that PIK3CA mutations are associated with resistance to preoperative chemotherapy in breast cancer, regardless of whether paclitaxel was also administered. The lack of association was true of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative tumors.	18371219	PubMed	Liedtke et al., 2008, Breast Cancer Res.	3.0	accepted	311	3	Somatic	f

Out of 40 BRCA (BRCA1 or BRCA2) mutant patients, 14 had germline BRCA1 mutation, 13 of which were homozygous mutation and one with unknown zygosity. Confirmed objective response was seen in 86% (12/14) of the germline BRCA1 mutant subgroup. Authors note that response rate was similar regardless of whether the BRCA mutation was somatic or germline, in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. In a BRCA wild-type subgroup, with low levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), confirmed objective response was observed in 10% (7/70) of the patients. Patients with BRCA mutant tumors experienced significantly longer median progression free survival than patients with BRCA wildtype, LOH low tumors (12.8 vs 5.2 mo, HR: 0.27, P<0.0001).	27908594	PubMed	Swisher et al., 2017, Lancet Oncol.	3.0	accepted	185	17	Rare Germline	f

Prior to nilotinib treatment, 105 and 9 patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations were imatinib resistant and intolerant, respectively. Within 12 months of therapy, among patients with baseline mutations, complete hematologic response was achieved in 57 (71%) of 80 [vs. 35 (80%) of 80 Abl1 wildtype patients, P = .393], major cytogenetic response in 49 of 100 [vs. 52 (60%) of 87, P = .145], complete cytogenetic response in 32 of 100 [vs. 35 (40%) of 87, P = .285], and major molecular response in 19 (22%) of 87 [vs. 22 (29%) of 76, P = .366]. These data shows no significant difference in nilotinib efficacy between patients with baseline mutations in the Abl1 kinase domain versus without.

6362	5290	Colorectal Cancer	9256.0	None	Cetuximab,Panitumumab	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	Mutational analysis of 110 metastatic colorectal cancer patients was used to examine objective tumor response, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) following treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). In univariate analysis, PIK3CA mutations (H1047R or E545K) were significantly associated with lack of response to panitumumab or cetuximab (objective response rate: 0/15 vs 22/95 for patients harboring PIK3CA mutated or wildtype tumors, respectively; P = 0.038). Multivariate logistic regression of KRAS mutations, PIK3CA mutations and PTEN protein expression also confirmed an independent effect of PIK3CA mutation on objective response (P = 0.0337; OR = 0.1153; CI for OR: 0.000–0.865). Patients with tumors harboring either PIK3CA H1047R or E545K mutations (15/109) had decreased PFS, compared to those with wild-type tumors (P = 0.0035), though they had a nonsignificant difference in OS.

Of 964 patients, 803 patients had wildtype PIK3CA (aspirin use: 337/803, no aspirin use: 466/803)  and 161 had mutated PIK3CA (aspirin use: 66/161, no aspirin use: 95/161). This study found that—among patients with mutated PIK3CA cancer— regular use of aspirin following diagnosis was correlated with superior colorectal cancer specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61; P<0.001) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.94; P = 0.01). Conversely, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer–specific survival or overall survival. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA tumors, 23 of 90 patients who did not use aspirin after diagnosis (26%) died within 5 years after diagnosis, whereas only 2 of 62 regular users of aspirin after diagnosis (3%) died within 5 years after diagnosis (P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA tumors, the 5-year cumulative colorectal cancer–specific mortality was the same (15%) for users and nonusers of aspirin after diagnosis (P = 0.92). The authors conclude that PIK3CA mutation may predict response to aspirin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer.	23094721	PubMed	Liao et al., 2012, N. Engl. J.

This line showed a significant reduction in colony formation (P = 0.0004) and MTT assay, which tests for NADH activity (P < 0.001), with imatinib vs vehicle treatment. There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses.	26758680	PubMed	Testoni et al., 2016, EMBO Mol Med	5.0	accepted	1656	9	Somatic	f

Patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 11 mutations (n=19) experienced higher rates of clinical benefit (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting >16 weeks) than patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 9 mutations.  15/19 patients with exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced clinical benefit (including 2 PRs). KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs treated with regorafenib monotherapy were associated with improved median progression free survival (13.4 months vs. 5.7 and 1.6 months, P<0.0001), as compared to patients with KIT exon 9 mutation (n=2) and patients with KIT wildtype, non-succinate dehydrogenase-deficient tumors (n=2).	27371698	PubMed	Ben-Ami et al., 2016, Ann.

Of 751 melanomas analyzed by next-generation sequencing, 4 metastatic melanomas were identified with NTRK fusions, 3 involving NTRK1 (TRIM63, DDR2, and GON4L), 1 involving NTRK2 (TRAF2). All tumors were cytologically characterized by the presence of large epithelioid melanocytes and were immunoreactive with anti-Trk antibody. The NTRK1-GON4L fusion occurred in a 36 yo woman with a nodular melanoma. Her primary tumor was on her back with a metastasis to the duodenum. NRAS Q61L was identified as a co-occurring melanoma driver in this patient. Thus, the presence of an NTRK family fusion in nonspitzoid metastasizing melanomas of adults may provide a therapeutic opportunity for NTRK inhibitors such as larotrectinib in a small subset of patients with metastatic melanoma.	29683819	PubMed	Lezcano et al., 2018, Am.

6409	2261	Transitional Cell Carcinoma	2671.0	None	Infigratinib	None	Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	In this one-arm study, 67 patients with metastastic urothelial carcinoma and diverse FGFR3 alterations were treated with pan-FGFR Inhibitor BGJ398. The majority of patients (70.1%) had received two or more prior antineoplastic therapies. An overall response rate of 25.4% was observed and an additional 38.8% of patients had disease stabilization. No clear differences between type of FGFR3 aberration and response could be seen. Four of five patients with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions had response data, with three achieving stable disease and one having a complete response. The authors conclude that BGJ398 appears to have moderate anticancer activity in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, that response rates and disease control rate exceed outcomes with most agents in this setting, and that enriching for patients with activating FGFR3 mutations together with the high specificity of BGJ398 for FGFR3 likely explains this improved response.	29848605	PubMed	Pal et al., 2018, Cancer Discov	3.0	accepted	830	4	Somatic	f

Eight families of JPS were analyzed and there was no evidence of linkage to SMAD4. The eight families and an additional 13 JPS cases were then tested for germline mutations. A single familial JPS patient had the missense mutation R361C in the MH2 domain of SMAD4, with potentially profound effects on protein function.

The authors compare NTRK3-ETV6 (and include 2 other NTRK fusion samples) to PTCs with BRAF(V) (600E) and find they are associated with large size (mean, 2.2 cm vs 1.5 cm, respectively; P = .05), solid and diffuse variants (11 of 13 vs 0 of 13 tumors, respectively; P < .001), and lymphovascular invasion (12 of 13 vs 6 of 13 tumors, respectively; P = .02); The authors conclude that NTRK fusion oncogene PTC presents with more extensive disease and aggressive pathology than BRAF(V) (600E) PTC in the pediatric population.	26784937	PubMed	Prasad et al., 2016, Cancer	3.0	accepted	801	12	Somatic	f

Over the next years, she experienced recurrence, multiple rounds of chemotherapy and metastasis -- until her case was presented at a virtual multidisciplinary tumor board organized by the Global Cancer Institute which recommended testing for ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. This fusion was confirmed by RNA-seq, targeted DNA and WGS sequencing as well as immunohistochemistry staining with a TRK antibody. The patient was treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in a single patient use protocol. Within two months, she experienced near complete resolution of a 10.4 × 8.5 cm fungating chest mass with multiple satellite lesions (See Figure 2). The authors note that TERT promoter mutation and a reciprocal inversion including CDKN2A were also identified, but given what is known about LOXO-101 and ETV6-NTRK3, they  infer ETV6-NTRK3 fusion as the primary mitogenic driver in this patient.	29623306	PubMed	Shukla et al., 2017, JCO Precis Oncol	3.0	accepted	801	12	Somatic	f

Of the 32 specimens, 11 were VHL-related HBs from 7 patients, and 21 were sporadic HBs from 21 patients. One of the 7 VHL patients was a female patient with a c.194C>T (p.Ser65Leu) mutation in the VHL gene. She developed a CNS hemangioblastoma in the cerebellum at 19Y. It is unclear whether she had germline testing. However, the patient met clinical criteria for VHL (Losner et al., 2003). Interestingly, the HB from this patient was noted to have LOH of chromosome 3p. No other phenotypic information was available.	28379443	PubMed	Takayanagi et al., 2017, Neuro-oncology	2.0	accepted	1788	3	Unknown	f

In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.	29880614	PubMed	Roberts et al., 2018, Blood	4.0	accepted	801	12	Somatic	f

Within 12 months of nilotinib therapy, there was no significant difference in response to nilotinib treatment between patients with mutations in the Abl1 kinase domain versus without. However, the authors identify Y253H, E255K/V, and F359C/V variants as resistant as they had an IC50 greater than 150 nM. In patients with E255K and/or E255V mutations prior to nilotinib treatment, complete hematological responses were achieved in 5 of 7 patients, major cytogenetic responses in 3 of 7 patients, complete cytogenetic responses in 0 of 7 patients, and a major molecular response in 1 of 7 patients. After a median follow-up of 15.5 months, 6 of 7 patients with this mutation progressed or died. The E255K mutation was present in 6 patients at baseline and newly emerged in 4 patients at progression. The E255V mutation was present in 0 patients at baseline and newly emerged in 3 patients at progression.	19652056	PubMed	Hughes et al., 2009, J. Clin. Oncol.	3.0	accepted	1173	9	Somatic	f

RNA studies demonstrated a Ph-like ALL expression signature but did not identify the underlying kinase fusion. Research level RNA sequencing identified a GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion which was confirmed by other methods and patient cells were introduced to patient-derived xenograft models that demonstrated a response to ruxolitinib. Therefore, 40mg/m2 ruxolitinib was added to the patient’s multiagent chemotherapy regiment. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient demonstrated significant clinical response by the end of consolidation, though MRD ≥ 0.01% was detected by flow cytometry. The patient received CART therapy and achieved MRD negative remission, then underwent HSCT, and remained in remission with full donor chimerism at 2-months post-HSCT.	29773603	PubMed	Ding et al., 2018, Haematologica	3.0	accepted	3214	None	Somatic	f

EGFR V441G/D/F mutations were found in 19% (n=8) of patients with EGFR ECD domain III (location of cetuximab and panitumumab binding epitope) mutations. V441D and V441G were more common than V441F. Resistance of V441G to cetuximab was modeled in silico, and authors predicted that it destroys a critical hydrophobic node. In vitro, V441G/D transduced NIH3T3 cells had significantly reduced binding to panitumumab and cetuximab compared to EGFR wt NH3T3 cells (p<0.01 for all comparisons to wt). Authors inferred that EGFR domain III (ECD) mutations, including V441F, may be responsible for secondary resistance to EGFR blockade.	29196463	PubMed	Strickler et al., 2018, Cancer Discov	2.0	accepted	2613	7	Somatic	f

Blood samples for genomic DNA analysis were taken and screening for mutations in SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, RET, SDHAF2, TMEM127, MAX, NF1, FH, MDH2, and EPAS1 genes was negative but she was positive for a heterozygous mutation in the VHL gene, c.311G > T (p.Gly104Val). This same variant was found in her 17 year-old sister and her mother but not in her father. Her mother refused a complete staging. The probands sister presented with a small retinal hemangioblastoma at this time. ACMG evidence codes: 'PM2' since this variant is absent from controls (gnomAD), 'PP1' since there is cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members, 'PP2' since we have a missense variant in a gene where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease, 'PP4' since the patient presents phenotypes highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.	29789510	PubMed	Bahougne et al., 2018, J Clin Med	3.0	accepted	2428	3	Rare Germline	f

Approximately 300 patients were included. Using Sanger sequencing, mutations at TERT promoter (TERTp) regions were identified (C228T: 3/278; C250T: 4/278). The median age of patients with TERTp mutations was 15 years. There were 5 males and 2 females. Six patients had diffuse astrocytoma and one had pilocytic astrocytoma. Tumors were found in the midline of four patients, the hemisphere of two, and the cerebellum of one. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that TERTp mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival [mt (n=6) vs wt (n=205); p<0.0001 for both OS and PFS]. However, the association of TERTp mutations with OS and PFS was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for age, grade, histology, tumor location, and extent of resection in multivariate analysis.	29948154	PubMed	Yang et al., 2018, Acta Neuropathol.	4.0	accepted	220	5	Somatic	f

Using flank xenograft model, mice were injected with NIH3T3 cells expressing KIAA1549-BRAF fusions and treated daily with trametinib, everolimus either alone or combined with each other (n=~10 for each treatment arm). Combination therapy (Trametinib 1mg/kg+ Everolimus 10mg/kg) resulted in better suppression in tumor growth than single-agent treatment. Similarly, combination treatment strongly reduced colony formation as well as pERK and pS6 levels, showing on target effects.	29156677	PubMed	Jain et al., 2017, Oncotarget	2.0	accepted	618	7	Somatic	f
7200	673	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	80830.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	Hawkins et al. (2011) retrospectively studied 70 consecutive patient with incompletely resected pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGA). KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was identified in 60% of cases in this cohort. Multi-variant analysis suggested that KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was the most significant favorable prognosis factor in incompletely resected PLGA and was independent of location, pathology, and age. Five-year PFS of fusion positive and fusion negative patients were 61% +/- 8% and 18% +/- 8% (P=0.0004), respectively. These results suggested that KIAA1549-BRAF fusion confers a less aggressive clinical phenotype on PLGA and may explain their tendency to growth arrest.	21610142	PubMed	Hawkins et al., 2011, Clin.

7203	2260	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	80830.0	Young adult onset,Pediatric onset	None	None	Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This GWAS study identified a structural variant of FGFR1. Duplication of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of FGFR1 was found in 11 of 149 patients (13/151 tumor samples, including 2 recurrent tumors) with pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) and related low-grade glioneuronal tumors (LGGNTs). This alteration resulted in autophosphorylation of FGFR1 and subsequent activation of downstream PI3K and MAPK/ERK pathways. Also, transfection of Tp53-null astrocytes with TDK duplicated FGFR1 and implantation into the brains of nude mice results in high-grade astrocytic tumours with short latency and complete penetrance. Of note, this variant was present in 24% (8 of 34) of grade II diffuse cerebral gliomas.	23583981	PubMed	Zhang et al., 2013, Nat. Genet.	4.0	accepted	2659	None	Somatic	f

The patient received a successful bone marrow transplant and at day 100 showed a complete remission (CR). The patient relapsed 6 months later, and second line therapy was unsuccessful. During this relapse, SNP microarray was performed on the diagnostic sample and identified amplification of 9q34 flanked by the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. Follow-up molecular studies confirmed a NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene. The patient was then started on dasatinib in combination with vincristine and dexamethasone. The patient achieved a second CR, and continued on dasatinib until her disease relapsed 2 months later.	26681761	PubMed	Duployez et al., 2016, Haematologica	2.0	accepted	2660	9	Somatic	f

The C238Y variant was considered severely deficient as cotransformation with empty vector resulted in poor transactivation of luciferase expression in 4 yeast strains compared to the p53 wildtype control vector (mean residual activity <25% of wildtype control). Cotransformation of C238Y and wildtype vectors led to the hinderance of luciferase expression below 90% compared to wildtype alone in all 4 yeast strains, which based on the authors criteria qualified the C238Y variant as dominant negative.	21343334	PubMed	Monti et al., 2011, Mol.

Tumor samples were obtained at the time of surgery and genotyped for PIK3CA mutations in exons 10 and 21 (listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common to exclude non-coding exon 1). PIK3CA mutations were identified in 19 cases (12 in exon 10 and 7 in exon 21). PIK3CA mutations were associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of recurrence of rectal tumors (5-year risk: 27.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.008). Furthermore, patients with PIK3CA mutations experienced a shorter time to recurrence compared to those with WT PIK3CA (median: 7.9 vs 19.6 months, p = 0.07). Patients with concomitant PIK3CA and KRAS mutations had a similar local reoccurrence rate to patients with PIK3CA mutations only. In multivariate analysis, PIK3A mutation was an independent predictor for the development of local recurrences (HR: 3.4, P =0.017).	19903786	PubMed	He et al., 2009, Clin.

7315	5290	Breast Cancer	1612.0	None	Fulvestrant,Alpelisib	Combination	Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase 3 trial, 572 patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 receptor negative advanced breast cancer who previously received endocrine therapy were allocated to alpelisib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutation status (N=341). PIK3CA mutation was determined according to the presence or absence of any hot spot mutation in the C2, helical, and kinase domains of PI3K (corresponding to exon 7, 9, and 20, respectively). In the cohort of patients with PIK3CA-mutated cancer, PFS was 11 months in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (HR 0.65, p<0.001). In the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer, the HR was 0.85. Analyses of PFS according to mutation types showed consistent benefit of treatment with alpelisib–fulvestrant across prespecified subgroups, including E542K (N=60, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.29-1.23), E545X, and H1047X.	31091374	PubMed	André et al., 2019, N.

Primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS), and median PFS according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1–16.6) with dacomitinib group 9.2 months (9.1–11.0) with gefitinib (HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·47–0·74; p<0·0001).  Benefit of dacomitinib over gefitinib was lower in non-Asian patient subgroup (n=106) than in Asian group (n=346) although authors note smaller sample size may explain this. Authors state that PFS was significantly improved with first line dacomitinib treatment, and that dacomitinib should be considered for EGFR mutant NSCLC treatment.	28958502	PubMed	Wu et al., 2017, Lancet Oncol.	4.0	accepted	442	7	Somatic	f

Ponatinib was very effective in targeting the FLT3-ITD mutation in MV4-11 cell lines (growth inhibition: IC50=2 nmol/L) compared to native FLT3 in RS4;11 cell lines (IC50>100 nmol/L). Additionally, MV4-11 cell lines incubated for 1 hour were shown to have reduced phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases beginning at a ponatinib concentration of 0.3 nmol/L. Ponatinib was shown to induce apoptotic mechanisms measured by caspase-3/7 activity in MV4-cell lines. In mice with the MV4-11 xenograft, ponatinib was very effective in targeting the FLT3-ITD mutation, as dosages of 1-5 mg/kg led to tumor growth inhibition and regression, while dosages of 10 and 25 mg/kg led to complete tumor regression. In primary blast cells from AML patients, Ponatinib was selectively effective in growth inhibition of the FLT3-ITD patient cells (n=1, IC50=4nmol/L) when compared to the native FLT3 patient cells (n=3, IC50>100nmol/L).	21482694	PubMed	Gozgit et al., 2011, Mol.

7383	10320	Childhood B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	80146.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study reports on two pediatric cohorts with B-ALL. In the first cohort of 221 high risk, BCR-ABL1-negative pediatric patients, 55.2% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 73.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 74.6% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event (hematologic relapse, any relapse, a second malignant condition or death) as compared to 14%, 25.2%, and 27.1%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. In a less selected cohort of 258 patients with both standard and high risk disease, with common aneuploidies including BCR-ABL1, 46.3% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 48.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 60.5% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event as compared to 22.5%, 25.6%, and 27.6%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. IKZF1 alteration is defined as a deletion or mutation in the gene. Gene expression profiles were found to be similar to BCR-ABL1 positive B-ALL, even when the BCR-ABL1 translocation was not present. The study concludes that IKZF1 alterations are associated with a very poor outcome in B-ALL.	19129520	PubMed	Mullighan et al., 2009, N. Engl. J. Med.	4.0	accepted	2744	None	Somatic	f

Saos-2 cells were transfected with TP53-R273H mutation and these cells were used in the study. Using a western blot, Saos-2/TP53-R273H cells were shown to have a 0.6-fold down-regulation (compared to the Control) for Procaspase-3 protein expression. In addition, Saos-2/TP53-R273H cells were shown to be more resistant to methotrexate and doxorubicin. Reduced levels of drug-induced apoptosis were seen in Saos-2/TP53-R273H cells treated with doxorubicin (0.05 uM and 0.10 uM) and methotrexate (25 nM and 50 nM) in DNA fragmentation assays. According to the results, TP53-R273H induces drug resistance when procaspase-3 is down-regulated.	17363498	PubMed	Wong et al., 2007, Mol. Cancer Ther.	3.0	accepted	122	17	Somatic	f

Mutation in the cohesin complex was not associated with worse overall survival (OS) or relapse free survival (RFS) compared to wildtype patients. The presence of STAG2 mutations had no influence on OS or RFS compared to wildtype (OS HR: 1.53, p = 0.4; RFS HR: 1.26, P = 0.7), though the authors note that the analysis was limited by the small number of patients.

Using a series of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lorlatinib was the most effective inhibitor of cytokine-independent growth. The glioblastoma cell line U118MG was shown to have the GOPC–ROS1 fusion. Lorlatinib and other TKIs were unable to inhibit growth of U118MG in standard growth assays (2D). However, lorlatinib did induce cell death in both ultra-low attachment dishes and spheroid assays, and significantly increased overall survival in an orthotopic intracranial xenograft model using this cell line (N=4) compared to mice on vehicle alone (N=4, p<0.001, ANOVA).

Compared to this PDAC cohort, significant overexpression of NRG1 (exons 2-7) was observed in the tumor. Of note, the EGF-like domain of NRG1 (exons 6 & 7), which is required for HER-family kinase activation, is preserved in the fusion. Treatment with afatinib resulted in significant clinical response as measured by imaging, as well as a drastic reduction in CA19-9 levels.

Cells were treated with and without DNA damaging agent and p53 inducing agent Daunorubicin and western blot used to assess p21 induction. p21 was induced in +/+ and +/-, but not -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- cells. Daunorubicin treatment caused less cell death in +/- than in +/+ cells, but induced significantly less death in -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/-, where these three conditions were not statistically different. A similar result was seen with p53 activating agent Nutlin-3a, where p53-/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- cells grouped together with equivalent resistance to the agent in comparison to +/+ and +/- cells. The grouping in results of  -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- suggest that R248Q inactivates the wt p53 copy, which does not occur in the +/- condition.	31395785	PubMed	Boettcher et al., 2019, Science	4.0	accepted	117	17	Unknown	f

B-RAF activity was determined using kinase dead MEK as a substrate. A727V activity was 14 times higher than basal WT BRAF. The authors classified A727V activity as intermediate, since its kinase activity was between basal WT BRAF and G12V RAS-activated WT B-RAF cells. In comparison, some BRAF variants displayed high kinase activity above the G12V RAS-activated WT BRAF cells.	15035987	PubMed	Wan et al., 2004, Cell	2.0	accepted	1198	7	Unknown	f

Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.	31665578	PubMed	Perl et al., 2019, N.

7784	1499	Desmoid Tumor	80366.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	None	This study illustrates the prevalence of CTNNB1 mutations in sporadic desmoid tumors, and examines whether the presence of CTNNB1 mutations correlates with the disease outcome. CTNNB1 mutations (including specific exon 3 mutations T41A, S45F, S45P, and S45C) were found in 106 out of 145 desmoid tumor specimens, and in 86 out of 115 specimens from patients who had undergone complete surgical resection. At a median follow-up of 31 months, the 5-year recurrence free survival rate of patients with the beta-catenin mutated tumors was worse than that of the patients with wild-type tumors (58% vs 74%), however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.285). Thus, the study shows that there is no statistically significant correlation between the CTNNB1 mutation and the recurrence risk of sporadic desmoid tumors, even though specific exon 3 CTNNB1 mutations are commonly identified in these tumors.	23960186	PubMed	Mullen et al., 2013, Oncologist	4.0	accepted	2892	3	Somatic	f

Combination therapy also synergistically reduced the cell viability of 5 primary B-ALL lines derived from diagnosis bone marrow compared to individual treatment. (Note: Expression of CDK4 was not quantitatively measured in the derived and primary B-ALL lines used). Further investigation in RCH-ACV and SEM lines revealed dexamethasone and Ribociclib combined increased apoptosis (annexin-V) and increased G1 arrest along with increased p16 (a CDK4 & CDK6 inhibitor) and decreased phosphorylation of downstream G1 to S cell cycle progression markers compared to single treatments.

Homozygosity mapping revealed their parents (who also had cancer) had a consanguineous union. Each sibling was homozygous for CHEK2 R474C. The brother also had a son who died of neuroblastoma at 22 months of age. Amino acid R474 is highly conserved (98%) and forms a salt bridge in both the inactive and active CHEK2 homodimer. Modeling reveals R474C likely negatively affects the saltbridge and destabilizes the protein. Calcium phosphate DNA precipitation to overexpress CHEK2 WT or R474C in NIH3T3 cells revealed limited expression of R474C and limited activation through phosphorylation after UV exposure compared to the WT CHEK2 controls.

FISH and nested PCR revealed the patient had a t(4;22)(q12;11) translocation that created an in-frame BCR-PDGFRA fusion. The constitutively activating coiled-coil domain and serine/threonine kinase encoded by BCR exon 1 fused with exon 13 of PDGFRA, which retained both tyrosine kinase domains. During initial therapy, intensification, and consolidation, hyperleukocytosis persisted. Based on the presence of the BCR-PDGFRA fusion, single agent imatinib (Glivec) was administered. A complete hematological response was observed within 6 weeks as the presence of t(4;22) in the bone marrow went from a 70% down to 15%. However, the patient had a relapse in the central nervous system. Continued treatment with imatinib along with intrathecal chemotherapy achieved a meningeal remission after 2 weeks.

Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This inhibitory mechanism allows for kinase inhibition to occur in the face of D835 mutation.	28516360	PubMed	Mori et al., 2017, Invest New Drugs	4.0	accepted	3011	None	Somatic	f

8193	4654	Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma	3260.0	None	None	None	Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This study evaluated forty-nine cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (17 cases of alveolar RMS, 10 of embryonal RMS, 21 of spindle cell and sclerosing RMS, and a single case of a pleomorphic RMS) for MYOD1 (L122R), PIK3CA (H1047), and PIK3CA (E542/E545) variants. All 10 cases that were positive for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant were either the spindle cell (3/12) or the sclerosing (7/9) subtypes of RMS, while all 10 cases of the embryonal subtype of RMS were negative for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant. The study suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is specific for spindle cell and sclerosing subtype of RMS (where it was detected in 10/21 cases or 48%). The study also confirmed the positive relationship between the spindle cell and the sclerosing subtypes of RMS, which both can have the same molecular abnormality (MYOD1 L122R variant) and are now considered to be the same subtype. Finally, the study confirmed the negative correlation between the aforementioned subtypes with the embryonal subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma.	27562493	PubMed	Rekhi et al., 2016, Mod.

None of the embryonal RMS cases was positive for the MYOD1 L122R variant. All cases were treated with surgical resection and either adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, or both. On patient follow-up, the alive-with-disease ratio was higher in the adult than in the pediatric population. Furthermore, the patients positive for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-positive states on follow-up, while the patients negative for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-free states on follow-up. This suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.34).	27562493	PubMed	Rekhi et al., 2016, Mod.

FISH and genomic analysis detected the EBF1-PDGFRB fusion (exon 11 with Exon14). The patient was treated with induction [fludarabine, idarubicin and cytarabine] therapy followed by additional chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and dexamethasone followed by high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine) plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI, imatinib). Imatinib was stopped 10 days before cord blood transplant (CBT) with reduced intensity conditional and re-initiated on day 47 until 12 months post-transplant. The EBF1-PDGFRB transcript level measured using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction remained below detection limit (<2.5x102 copies/ microgram RNA) for 36 months post CBT. Furthermore, the patient maintained molecular remission during the 24 months post-CBT and the 12 months following completion of TKI administration, based on minimal residual disease (MRD) testing conducted every 6 months.	32068648	PubMed	Sakurai et al., 2020, J.

Authors found that loss of PTEN expression induced resistance to lapatinib as assessed by colony formation assay compared to PTEN expressing control cells. Among lapatinib treated cells, concentration of phosphorylated AKT and ERK was substantially higher in cells with PTEN loss compared to PTEN expressing cells, by western blot. Furthermore, athymic nude mice injected with PTEN non-expressing BT474 cells had significantly higher mean tumor volume following lapatinib monotherapy compared to mice injected with PTEN expressing BT474. Authors conclude that loss of PTEN expression confers resistance to lapatinib in HER2 positive breast cancer cells.	19010894	PubMed	Eichhorn et al., 2008, Cancer Res.	4.0	accepted	214	10	Somatic	f

PTEN loss resulted in partial rescue from the strong dactolisib induced reduction of colony formation that was seen in BT474 cells with unperturbed PTEN. Among cells treated with dactolisib (100nmol/L), those lacking PTEN expression demonstrated higher concentrations of phosphorylated AKT (S473) and phosphorylated ERK compared to PTEN expressing cells.	19010894	PubMed	Eichhorn et al., 2008, Cancer Res.	2.0	accepted	214	10	Somatic	f

Authors found that while PTEN loss induced resistance to lapatinib, combination with dactolisib produced an additive anti-proliferation effect. Western blot analysis of lapatinib and dactolisib combination treated cells showed a decrease in phosphorylated AKT and S6 relative to untreated and lapatinib treated control cells.

8313	4654	Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma	3260.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study examined 17 cases of spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (SC/SRMS) for the presence of MYOD1 variants. 12 cases harbored a MYOD-1 mutation, of which 8 cases were homozygous for p.L122R, 3 were heterozygous for p.L122R, and 1 was heterozygous for a novel p.E118K variant. There was one case of predominantly spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma with the MYOD-1 mutation that also contained a PIK3CA mutation. The case with both MYOD-1 and PIK3CA mutations consisted histologically of lipoblasts within focally myxoid stroma, thus demonstrating that the PIK3CA mutation was a secondary aberration while MYOD-1 was the primary neomorphic mutation. On clinical follow-up, seven of the MYOD-1 variant cases experienced local recurrences and/or metastatic disease. In a median of a 13.5 month follow-up, there was 1 patient who passed away, 8 patients who were alive with the disease, and 3 patients who were alive without the disease; there was no correlation with the type of treatment that the patients had received. This supports aggressive clinical course for SC/SRMS positive for MYOD-1 variants, regardless of the presence of a concurrent PIK3CA mutation.	30604891	PubMed	Tsai et al., 2019, Histopathology	3.0	accepted	3032	11	Somatic	f

Of PIK3CA mutant HER2 patients, those treated with T-DM1 experienced a greater decrease in disease progression than those treated with standard of care capecitabine + lapatinib. In vitro, HER2 amplified cell lines with various PIK3CA mutations were associated with similar sensitivity to T-DM1 as PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3. In mouse xenograft models of various PIK3CA mutations (H1047R, E545K, or K111N), tumor regression or complete tumor suppression >20 days was seen following a single dose >10mg/kg for all models.	26920887	PubMed	Baselga et al., 2016, Clin.

A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.	29804288	PubMed	López et al., 2019, Neuropathol. Appl.

Of 133 binimetinib-treated patients with individual response and molecular data, 46 harbored KRAS mutations. KRAS mutation status was significantly associated with local best response (P=0.004); 44% of patients with KRAS mutation versus 19% of patients with KRAS WT had CR or PR in the binimetinib arm. KRAS mutation was also associated with prolonged PFS in patients treated with binimetinib (median PFS: KRAS mutant: 17.7 months; KRAS wild-type (WT): 10.8 months; P = .006), but not in patients receiving standard chemotherapy (physicians' choice, median PFS: KRAS mutant: 14.6 months; KRAS WT: 11.5 months; P=.502).	32822286	PubMed	Monk et al., 2020, J.

Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. In vivo, SW48 cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Treatment with regorafenib did not lead to a significant delay of tumor growth, although KRAS wt mice trended toward better response than KRAS G12C expressing mice. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed more pronounced changes in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31), and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS wt mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS G12C mice whose tumors did not display changes in these markers. Authors concluded that KRAS wildtype was not resistant to regorafenib compared to other common KRAS G12/G13 mutations.	26161928	PubMed	Camaj et al., 2015, Future Oncol	2.0	accepted	3200	12	Somatic	t

Steady state competition surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated a ~177 fold decrease in venetoclax affinity for G101V (Ki=3.2nM) versus WT (Ki=.018nM). Resistance is acquired by a knock-on effect in the P2 pocket of V101 on an adjacent residue, E152 as affinity for venetoclax was restored in BCL2 G101V through the introduction of an E152A mutation (Ki =.002nM). Additionally, BCL2 G101V maintains similar affinity for apoptotic BH3 peptides, which assists in the prevention of apoptosis.	31160589	PubMed	Birkinshaw et al., 2019, Nat Commun	3.0	accepted	2960	18	Somatic	f

FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. After 4 weeks of treatment with Entrectinib, CT scan revealed the patient showed a partial response with a 30% reduction of target lesions. This response was maintained for 5 months.	26563355	PubMed	Sartore-Bianchi et al., 2016, J Natl Cancer Inst	4.0	accepted	3225	1	Somatic	f

Expression was confirmed by Western and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. Western blot of the tumor also indicated constitutive activation of the fusion based on phosphorylation of the fusion. Additionally, downstream kinase targets (PLCγ1, AKT, and MAPK) were also phosphorylated in the tumor, similar to levels observed in the TPM3-NTRK1 containing KM12 colorectal cancer cell line.	26563355	PubMed	Sartore-Bianchi et al., 2016, J Natl Cancer Inst	1.0	accepted	3225	1	Somatic	f

Compared to controls (wildtype NTRK1 overexpression and GFP), lentiviral mediated overexpression of LMNA-NTRK1 in mouse melanocyte cells (melan-a) displayed increased phosphorylation of the fusion and downstream kinase targets, as assessed by Western Blot. Treatment with the NTRK1 inhibitor, AZ-23, quenched fusion and pathway activation. Additionally, injection of LMNA-NTRK1 melan-a cells into immunocompromised mice resulted in the rapid growth of tumors at the injection site within 40 days. Similar results were observed in mice injected with melan-a cells overexpressing NRAS G12V or HRAS G12V, but no tumors were observed in mice injected with GFP control melan-a cells.	24445538	PubMed	Wiesner et al., 2014, Nat Commun	3.0	accepted	3224	None	Somatic	f
8917	4916	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	80630.0	Juvenile onset	Larotrectinib,Methotrexate,Etoposide	Combination	Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.	31725893	PubMed	Schewe et al., 2019, Blood Adv	4.0	accepted	801	12	Somatic	f
8923	2322	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119.0	None	Gilteritinib	None	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	This study was designed to test the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in vitro against FLT3-ITD and other TKD variants clinically observed. IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells.	27908881	PubMed	Lee et al., 2017, Blood	3.0	accepted	55	13	Somatic	f
8924	2322	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119.0	None	Gilteritinib	None	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	In vitro gilteritinib treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells, which endogenously express FLT3-ITD, showed growth suppression based on CellTiter GLO cytotoxicity assays with IC50 values of 0.92 nM (95% CI: 0.23–3.6 nM) and 2.9 nM (95% CI: 1.4–5.8 nM), respectively. Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15. Gilteritinib treated mice showed significantly less widespread disease at day 42 than control counterparts (N=10, p<0.001) and significantly improved survival (log-rank, p<0.001).	28516360	PubMed	Mori et al., 2017, Invest New Drugs	4.0	accepted	55	13	Somatic	f

RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).	31725893	PubMed	Schewe et al., 2019, Blood Adv	3.0	accepted	801	12	Somatic	f
8931	4916	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	80630.0	None	None	None	Oncogenic	None	D	None	The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.	29880614	PubMed	Roberts et al., 2018, Blood	4.0	accepted	801	12	Somatic	f

Fifty-four Black patients presenting with phaeochromocytoma between 1980 and 2009 were included. Two patients had VHL syndrome (submitted for publication). The second diagnosis of VHL syndrome was made in the pregnant woman (Case 9) who had bilateral adrenal phaeochromocytomas. There were no clinical features of VHL syndrome; however, MRI showed a haemangioblastoma in the cervical spine. Genetic testing revealed a missense mutation (c.499C>T) in the VHL gene, located on chromosome 3p26-p25. Her 6-year-old daughter screened positive for the mutation; her 8-year-old son was negative. Both mother and daughter will be investigated further and monitored long-term. ACMG PP4	21382250	PubMed	Huddle, 2011, S Afr Med J	3.0	accepted	1747	3	Rare Germline	f

9018	673	Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma	3969.0	None	Vemurafenib	None	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	Open label phase 2 (Clinical Level B) trial including patients from across the globe (USA, Italy, and the Netherlands) investigating sensitivity to Vemurafenib in patients that have BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer that have become resistant to radioactive iodine (the standard treatment). There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control. (55% of total cohort 2, 95% CI 32-76). The authors conclude that vemurafenib is a potential treatment option for late-stage BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer for treatment in patients naïve to a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 1) and to patients that have been previously treated with a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 2).	27460442	PubMed	Brose et al., 2016, Lancet Oncol.	4.0	accepted	12	7	Somatic	f

9073	25	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	80650.0	None	None	None	Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This study determined the incidence, clinical characteristics and associated genetic abnormalities in hematologic malignancies with the ETV6-ABL1 fusion. The total of 44 new and previously published ETV6-ABL1 positive cases were detected and characterized using conventional cytogenetics, FISH, RT-PCR, SNP/copy number arrays, expression arrays and a custom Taqman 'low-density array' (LDA card). Among the 44 cases, there were 22 cases of B-ALL (13 children, 9 adults), and 22 myeloid malignancies (18 myeloproliferative neoplasms, and 4 acute myeloid leukemias). The 9 ETV6-ABL1 positive ALL cases (7 diagnosis and 2 relapse samples) that underwent whole genome expression profiling displayed similar expression profiles to the BCR-ABL1 positive leukemia cohort. Also, 9/10 ETV6-ABL1 BCP-ALL cases were classified by custom Taqman assay (designed to detect BCR-ABL1-like expression signature) as BCR-ABL1-like. The study thus shows that in B-ALL, the presence of the ETV6-ABL1 fusion correlates with the BCR-ABL1 like (Ph-like) subtype of the disease.	27229714	PubMed	Zaliova et al., 2016, Haematologica	4.0	accepted	2575	None	Somatic	f

Two cases were positive for the NUP214-ABL1 fusion, identified by RNA-seq analysis. In both cases the fusion was generated by a small copy number gain (duplication) in 9q34, with the breakpoints in the two partner genes. Considering the previously shown Ph-like expression signature in the studied cases, the results suggest association of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion in B-ALL with the Ph-like genetic subtype of the disease.	22897847	PubMed	Roberts et al., 2012, Cancer Cell	2.0	accepted	2660	9	Somatic	f

FISH using a BCR-ABL1 probe demonstrated 50-80 extrachromosomal copies of ABL1; FISH using probes to the 3' regions of ABL1 and NUP214 confirmed NUP214-ABL1 amplification in ~99% of cells. The NUP214-ABL1 amplification was also confirmed by MLPA and SNP6.0 analysis. Additionally, this patient harbored a focal deletion of IKZF1 (exons 2-7) and CDKN2A/B (exons 1-2). Day 29 marrow showed complete morphological remission; however PCR-based IgVH MRD rearrangement studies revealed clonal IgVH rearrangement (1 in 10^4 cells). Patient underwent sibling donor allogenic stem cell transplant, and at 4 months is in complete remission. NUP214-ABL1 positive patient primary cells were cultured with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib). After 72-hour culture there was no significant reduction in viable cell numbers or increase in apoptosis, when compared to the no drug control. The in vitro sensitivity to TKIs may be attributed to variable NUP214-ABL1 copy number and/or focal deletions of IKZF1 and CDKN2A/B.	23175662	PubMed	Eyre et al., 2012, Blood	2.0	accepted	2660	9	Somatic	f

Chromosome and FISH analysis using a BCR-ABL1 probe confirmed the involvement of ABL1 in a t(9;10)(q34;q22.3) translocation. Follow-up molecular analysis using RT-PCR confirmed the presence of a ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion transcript (ZMIZ1 exon 14 and ABL1 exon 2). Patient was treated according to standard risk protocol without kinase inhibitors and is in first complete remission. Authors note that The ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion transcript predicts the the synthesis of ZMIZ1-ABL fusion protein, which contains one of the proline-rich domains of ZMIZ1 and ABL tyrosine kinase domain. Similar to other oncogenic fusion proteins, the proline-rich domain of ZMIZ1 is involved in protein-protein interactions, and therefore the fusion may encode a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that promotes cellular transformation. The authors further note that patients with t(9;10) would be eligible for imatinib treatment.	18007576	PubMed	Soler et al., 2008, Leukemia	1.0	accepted	3269	10	Somatic	f

RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing for detection of tyrosine kinase fusions was performed for 153 cases. There were 14 fusions found among the BCR-ABL-like cases (14/77=18%), which included one case with a ZMIZ1-ABL1 (exon 18 and exon 2). ZMIZ1-AML1 fusion was among a group of nine fusions found, and characterized by the authors as predictive for activated ABL signaling. The 8-year cumulative incidence of relapse for the fusion-positive BCR-ABL1-like group (35%) was comparable to the fusion-negative BCR-ABL1-like group (35%), and worse than non-BCR-ABL1-like B-other group (17%, p=0.07).	27894077	PubMed	Boer et al., 2017, Oncotarget	2.0	accepted	3269	10	Somatic	f

Of the 24 patients reported, 12 had fusions involving ABL1 including 1 case with LSM14A-ABL1. The patient with LSM14A-ABL1 was a 36 year old male who also had a IKZF1 intragenic deletion. He had a poor prednisone response and did not reach complete remission after vincristine-dexamethasone-rituximab or a combination of dasatinib and chemotherapy, although some of the patients in this case series appeared to benefit from the introduction of TKIs.

Macrophages derived from the knockout mice were significantly more sensitive to 5-FU (P<0.05) compared to macrophages derived from wild-type mice, as demonstrated by reduced survival by TUNEL assays. Re-introduction of ATRX rescued cells from 5-FU treatment. Similar significant (P<0.05) increases in TUNEL-positive cells were seen for ATRX-deficient neurons treated with 5-FU, as well as myoblasts and embryonic fibroblasts treated with 5-FU or cisplatin.

9158	25	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	80630.0	Young adult onset	None	None	Oncogenic	None	C	None	The authors describe two cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with the t(1;9)(p34;q34) rearrangement, resulting in a fusion between the pre-mRNA processing protein gene SFPQ and the ABL1 kinase gene. Patient 1 was a 19-year old female patient with common B-cell ALL expressing 2 myeloid markers. Due to the presence of the 2 myeloid markers, she was treated with a classic acutemyeloid leukemia (AML) induction regimen (cytarabine and idarubicin), along with imatinib due to the involvement of the ABL1 locus. Patient achieved complete remission, followed by a consolidation regimen with cytarabine and mitoxantrone, a non-familial allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a dose-reduced conditioning, and a maintenance treatment with dasatinib. Complete remission was maintained 32 months after the allograft. Patient 2 was a 28 year old female, diagnosed with common B-ALL (EGIL B-II), and was included in the GRAALL 2005 protocol with intensified cyclophosphamide administration, and was corticosensitive but chemoresistant (60% blasts at day 8). She achieved complete remission after the induction regimen, and this was followed by consolidation regimen with cytarabine, high-dose methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. After this, familial allograft with her brother as donor was performed, and she remained in complete remission 18 months after allograft. FISH and sequencing have confirmed the fusion between SFPQ-ex9 and ABL-ex4 in both patients. The authors conclude that the t(1;9)(p34;q34), fusing SFPQ in 1p34 with ABL1 in 9q34, represents a recurrent abnormality in B-ALL.	21388681	PubMed	Duhoux et al., 2011, Leuk Res	3.0	accepted	3287	None	Somatic	f

Three (6%) of the adult but none of the childhood B-other cases were positive for ABL-class aberrations. One of these adult patients was a 29-year old male with a t(1;9)(p34;q34). RT-PCR and sequencing confirmed that the translocation resulted in a rare SFPQ-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated with allogenic stem-cell transplant with addition of dasatinib and imatinib, and was in remission at the time of publication (28 months after the diagnosis). A review of 6 previously published cases with SFPQ-ABL1 fusion indicated that exon 9 of SFPQ and exon 4 of ABL1 were consistently involved. The fusion was typically found in adolescents/younger adults without hyperleukocytosis, and IKZF1 deletions were recurrently found. In the cases reported, patients who were not treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation had relapsed, and the authors therefore suggest that TKIs should be added to the therapy of SFPQ-ABL1-positive B-ALL.	32306475	PubMed	Biloglav et al., 2020, Genes Chromosomes Cancer	3.0	accepted	3287	None	Somatic	f

The fusion was confirmed by amplification of the genomic breakpoints and RT-PCR; it was shown to be in-frame and to encode the N-terminal domain of the SFPQ-encoded protein and the entire tyrosine kinase domain and C-terminal sequences of the ABL1 kinase. The SFPQ (Splicing Factor Proline And Glutamine Rich) gene, encoding a protein that specifically binds to intronic polypyrimidine tracts in pre-mRNA and regulates signal-induced alternative splicing, was thus described as a new 5’ partner of the ABL1 gene in B-ALL.	18205209	PubMed	Hidalgo-Curtis et al., 2008, Genes Chromosomes Cancer	2.0	accepted	3287	None	Somatic	f

9170	673	Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma	3969.0	None	None	None	Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	Clinical study including 219 patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) to determine a correlation between the BRAF V600E mutation and poor oncological outcome. This study found that 107 of the 219 (49%) patients had this mutation signifying that the BRAF V600E mutation is one of the most commonly occurring among PTC patients. This cohort was split into two groups—BRAF+ and BRAF-. Of the 107 patients that were BRAF+, 25% had tumor reoccurrence compared with 9% in the BRAF- group (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis was performed to assess BRAF correlation independent of known contributing factors to cancer such as age, gender, and multifocality. The results showed that the BRAF mutation is indicative/contributes to lymph node metastasis, associated with tumor reoccurrence, stage, and that recurrent disease was more extensive and required more aggressive treatments in BRAF+ patients compared with BRAF- patients. The authors conclude that PTC patients with the BRAF V600E mutation have worse clinicopathological outcomes, and that the BRAF mutation can be used to assess risk stratification in patients with PTC.	16174717	PubMed	Xing et al., 2005, J Clin Endocrinol Metab	4.0	accepted	12	7	Somatic	f
9164	25	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	80630.0	Young adult onset	Dasatinib	None	Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	Authors reported a 40-yr-old male patient with pre-B ALL and t(1;9)(q24;q34) translocation. Two different RCSD1-ABL1 fusion transcripts, presumably resulting from alternative splicing, were identified, one consisting of the first three exons of RCSD1 fused to ABL1 starting from exon 4, the second of the first two exons of RCSD1 fused to exon 4 of ABL1. The patient received a modified CVAD induction therapy. After 2 induction courses, the BM had residual disease with 50% of leukemic blasts. At day 10 from the start of the 3rd induction regimen, dasatinib was introduced at a dose of 140 mg once daily. Two weeks later morphological remission was confirmed, and only minimal residual disease (1.5% of leukemic cells) was detectable by FISH. The first consolidation therapy consisted of dasatinib 140 mg once daily and high-dose methotrexate. BM at four weeks post consolidation showed complete morphological and cytogenetic remission (CCyR). Dasatinib was continued until an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed four months after diagnosis. After transplantation, no TKI therapy was used. At 12 months from HSCT, the patient experienced a cytogenetic relapse and a month later a hematologic relapse. Immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued, and the patient received a re-induction therapy with dasatinib 70 mg twice daily combined with one cycle of high-dose chemotherapy. The patient successfully reentered in CCyR, which has been maintained with dasatinib monotherapy for more than nine months.	19794096	PubMed	Mustjoki et al., 2009, Haematologica	3.0	accepted	2681	None	Somatic	f

Conventional cytogenetics and FISH identified t(1;9)(q23;q34) and RCSD1ABL1 fusion. Microarray identified an approximately 70 kb deletion at 7p12.2 disrupting the IKZF1 gene. The patient was enrolled on AALL-1131 and received a 4-drug induction therapy with Vincristine/Daunorubicin/Pegaspargase/Prednisone. Her day 8 peripheral blood minimal residual disease (MRD) testing showed 18–25% blasts and her day 29 bone marrow evaluation revealed induction failure. She continued chemotherapy per the very high-risk control arm of AALL-1131 with the addition of dasatinib due to the RCSD1-ABL1 fusion. Her consolidation course was complicated due to presumed fungal infection and C. difficile colitis, but she was able to complete the consolidation treatment. The last bone marrow done on November 2014 showed no evidence of persistent/recurrent leukemia. The patient had a bone marrow transplant from a sibling in November 2014, but a few weeks after transplant she developed severe sepsis as well as capillary leak syndrome. She remained admitted to the intensive care unit where she unfortunately died on March 12, 2015.	26600955	PubMed	Kamran et al., 2015, Case Rep Hematol	2.0	accepted	2681	None	Somatic	f

RT-PCR and sequence analyses detected transcription of a single RCSD1-ABL1 fusion gene variant, which had breakpoints in exon 3 of RCSD1 and exon 4 of ABL1. The patient was treated with hyper-CVAD combination without achieving complete remission (CR). Therefore, the patient was treated with combination chemotherapy comprising 800 mg of imatinib for 7 days and 40 mg of dexamethasone for 4 days followed by 140 mg of dasatinib daily. On day 74, lymphoblasts disappeared from the peripheral blood, but 15% remained in the bone marrow. A second course of hyper-CVAD with 140 mg of dasatinib daily was administered. Twenty days after therapy using 1.5 g of methotrexate and cytarabine (total dose; 18 g), lymphoblasts suddenly increased by 82%. Administration of 40 mg of dexamethasone for 4 days was highly effective in reducing lymphoblast count. Administration of triplicated dexamethasone and dasatinib achieved stable disease with partial remission in the bone marrow. However, during the seventh administration of dexamethasone, the disease recurred and there was no further response to treatment.	21863287	PubMed	Inokuchi et al., 2011, Int J Hematol	3.0	accepted	2681	None	Somatic	f

The RCSD1-ABL1 t(1;9)(q22;q34) fusion between exon 3 of RCSD1 and exon 4 of ABL1 was identified by RT-PCR. The patient was enrolled on GMALL elderly (01/2003) and treated accordingly with an induction failure. She therefore continued chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and asparaginase. Her disease achieved first complete remission in January 2013, and high-dose cytarabine was administered. The patient experienced a BM relapse in April 2013. Re-induction chemotherapy with one cycle of FLAG-Ida comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, GCSF and idarubicin was administered, but BM revealed residual disease with 70% of leukemic blasts in May 2013. The patient was included in the BEZ235 study and treated with an oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, but no remission could be achieved. Salvage therapy with single agent dasatinib was initiated at a dose of 100 mg once daily, in July 2013. A stable disease with partial remission in the BM was achieved. Moreover, inhibition of RCSD1-ABL1 activity by dasatinib was shown by Western analysis of phosphorylated ABL1 and its downstream target CRKL. Treatment with dasatinib was complemented with two cycles of chemotherapy, including clofarabine and cyclophosphamide. CR 2 was achieved in October 2013, whereas minimal residual disease (MRD) levels still remained positive. In this regard, treatment with blinatumomab was started within the MT103-203 study in January 2014, and MRD levels became negative. In March 2014, allo-SCT was performed successfully. Since then, there is an ongoing remission that, to date, has lasted 30 months.	28057740	PubMed	Frech et al., 2017, Haematologica	3.0	accepted	2681	None	Somatic	f

During multiple periods of short remission and relapse she was treated with high risk induction chemotherapy, craniospinal irradiation and matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant. Finally, WES and RNA-seq were performed on the tumor and normal samples, which identified a cryptic ETV6-ABL1 fusion as well as a biallelic CDKN2A deletion. She was administered imatinib and achieved a morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remission, which were maintained for 18 months. After a fourth relapse, clinical sequencing was repeated and ultimately identified the persisting ETV6-ABL1 fusion (with no mutation identified in the kinase domain of ABL1) as well as a previously undetected MLL2-ADCY9 fusion resulting in truncation of MLL2 (also known as KMT2D). Treatments of Dasatinib, Ponatinib, and Panobinostat were unsuccessful and the patient ultimately succumbed to her disease 7 year after her initial diagnosis.	30028819	PubMed	Mankuzhy et al., 2019, J Pediatr Hematol Oncol	3.0	accepted	2575	None	Somatic	f

The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.	27176795	PubMed	Imamura et al., 2016, Blood Cancer J	3.0	accepted	2678	5	Somatic	f

Of the 24 patients reported, 12 had fusions involving ABL1; in 7/12 patients the ABL1 fusion was detected at diagnosis, and in 5/12 it was identified at relapse. One relapse patient was found to have a RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. This patient was a 20 year old female. An IKZF1 intragenic deletion was detected in her leukemia in addition to the RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. She had good initial prednisone response and reached complete remission (CR) after treatment on the GRAALL2005R trial. However, she relapsed with refractory disease. The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion was detected at relapse, and dasatinib (140 mg daily) was added to chemotherapy; this resulted in a brief response even though her leukemia was previously refractory to several lines of salvage treatment (best MRD level 8x10-3). However, the patient experienced another relapse and died of progressive disease. The case illustrates partial response to TKIs in combination with chemotherapy in a relapsed Ph-like B-ALL with RANBP2-ABL1 fusion.	31434701	PubMed	Tanasi et al., 2019, Blood	2.0	accepted	3268	2	Somatic	f
9212	5518	None	None	None	None	None	Functional	Supports	D	Loss of Function	Immunoprecipitation experiments in a serous endometrial carcinoma cell line that expressed V5 tagged PPP2R1A P179R protein revealed that binding of PPP2R1A to the PP2A holoenzyme complex members was significantly reduced for PPP2R1A P179R compared to wildtype protein. In vitro reconstitution of the PPP2A holoenzyme was also inhibited by PPP2R1A P179R. Crystal structures of the mutant and wildtype proteins revealed changes in PPP2R1A protein structural conformation that impacts the interaction with the PPP2CA C-subunit, and increases the binding energy between the PPP2R1A and PPP2CA subunits from 236 to 347 kJ/mol for wildtype and mutant protein, respectively. Cell lines that expressed PPP2R1A P179R had increased proteosome-mediated degradation of the PPP2CA (C-subunit), PPP2R2A (B55α) and PPP2R5A (B56α) subunits. Together, this evidence points to PPP2R1A P179R mediated disruption of the PPP2A complex.	31142515	PubMed	Taylor et al., 2019, Cancer Res	4.0	accepted	3299	None	Somatic	f

Ex vivo drug response profiling (DRP) of the patient leukemic blasts was performed at first relapse. Resistance and/or low response were observed for dasatinib and nilotinib, and measurable responses were noted to ponatinib. This differential response to ponatinib as compared with dasatinib was confirmed in a secondary dose-response study and in mice inoculated with leukemia cells. Then the patient was started on ponatinib monotherapy (45 mg/day) based on her RCSD1-ABL1 fusion and achieved a remission. She received a second HSC transplant but relapsed at day 77 post transplantation. Ponatinib was restarted at this time that resulted in response but didn’t reach remission.

Immunofluorescence revealed that the P250L mutant cell line had reduced nuclear and increased cytoplasmic staining as compared to the wildtype. The punctate staining suggested that the P250L mutant forms large aggregates within the perinucleus. Chemical disruption of the microtubule assembly resulted in a shift from punctate to diffuse cytoplasmic staining in the P250L cell line. The oligomerization state of the wild type and P250L p53 was analyzed using Blue-Native PAGE (BN-PAGE) and western blot analysis: It was found that the wild type p53 appeared as monomers, tetramers and octamers while the P250L p53 formed large masses. More importantly, it was found that the formation of these aggregates by the P250L mutant could lead to co-aggregation of the wild-type p53, causing dominant negative activity. Additionally, the P250L mutant was found to inactivate the p53 paralogs, p63 and p73, while upregulating HSP70 and HSP90.	21445056	PubMed	Xu et al., 2011, Nat Chem Biol	5.0	accepted	3318	None	Unknown	f

Methyltransferase activity assays showed that the Y641 mutants were more effective than the wildtype in catalyzing dimethyl to trimethyl reactions. In comparison to the wildtype, the enzyme turnover and catalytic efficiency for the mutants was lower for the non methylated and monomethylated substrates, and higher for dimethylated substrates. Western blots of patient derived lymphoma cell lines (one homozygous wildtype and four heterozygous Y641 mutant lines) supported steady state enzyme kinetic predictions where the homozygous wildtype line demonstrated increased me1 and me2, but decreased 3me at H3K27. Alternatively, the heterozygous lines displayed increased 3me but decreased me1 and me2 at H3K27. These results suggest both the wildtype and Y641 mutants contribute to trimethylation and therefore the altered expression signature.	21078963	PubMed	Sneeringer et al., 2010, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	3.0	accepted	165	7	Somatic	f

PIP3 immunostaining was used to compared PI3K activity among mutant and control cell lines. The mutant cell line had increased PIP3 levels compared to the control, pointing to increased PI3K activity, since PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3. Use of PI3K inhibitor, PI-103, led to reduction of PIP3 levels in the mutant cell line, suggesting that the impact of the PIK3R2 mutation on PIP3 levels depends on PI3K.	22729224	PubMed	Rivière et al., 2012, Nat Genet	1.0	accepted	3381	None	Rare Germline	f

In PTEN-C136R cells, PTEN protein expression was significantly reduced, PTEN mRNA levels was comparable to wildtype(wt), and proteasome activity was 30% greater than wt. This increased proteasomal activity was also found in MCF-7 and HEK-293 cell lines transfected with C136R-PTEN, and in mice expressing C136R-PTEN. Further experiments found the mutant localizes to the cytosol, where its increased proteasomal activity is observed. Cycloheximide (CHX) treatment of MCF-7 cells expressing wt or C136R-PTEN revealed this mutant to be highly unstable. Using P-AKT and P-ERK as markers of PI3K and MAPK pathway activity, respectively, it was found that C136R-PTEN resulted in increased fold change of both, inferring increased pathway activation. The authors further inferred that the mutant results in impaired PTEN lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase.	23475934	PubMed	He et al., 2013, Cancer Res	3.0	accepted	3382	None	Unknown	f

The authors classified G463E activity as intermediate since its kinase activity was between basal WT BRAF and G12V RAS-activated WT B-RAF cells. In comparison, some BRAF variants displayed high kinase activity above the G12V RAS-activated WT BRAF cells. NIH3T3 transformation assay yielded 24 +/- 14 foci/ng of transfected BRAF DNA, in comparison to WT, which yielded zero foci, indicating an oncogenic effect of BRAF G463E.	15035987	PubMed	Wan et al., 2004, Cell	3.0	accepted	3432	None	Unknown	f

The analysis was done using a custom-capture sequencing assay. MYOD1 L122R variant was identified in 17 cases (3%) and was not restricted to spindle-cell histology, but was also observed in association with other histologic patterns (including cases with densely packed cells that mimicked embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) or RMS not otherwise specified ). MYOD1 mutation showed association with older age, head and neck primary site, and a dismal survival. In both COG and UK patient cohorts, patients with the MYOD1 L122R mutation had rapid disease progression and significantly worse event free survival as compared to the patients with wild-type MYOD1.	34166060	PubMed	Shern et al., 2021, J Clin Oncol	4.0	accepted	3032	11	Somatic	f

The NFE2L2:p.G31A allele was also found to be expressed at significantly higher levels as compared to wild type. Short term gene expression correlation analysis was also completed using HA1E cells and the L1000 Luminex bead-based gene expression assay. Transcript level of 978 landmark genes were measured to formulate a gene expression signature for the allele. Overexpression of the mutant allele led to a similar signature as overexpression of the wild type, suggesting that the gain-of-function changes induced by the mutant can also be seen in NFE2L2-overexpressed cells.	27147599	PubMed	Kim et al., 2016, Cancer Discov	3.0	accepted	3457	None	Unknown	f

Molecular testing included 39 genes which had been implicated in the past with regards to RMS. The analysis was performed with a custom-capture sequencing assay. Altered TP53 was noted in 69 out of 515 FOXO1 fusion-negative RMS cases (13%), with the most frequent mutations at codons G245S (6 cases), R248Q or W (6 cases), R175H (4 cases), and P72A (4 cases). These cases displayed a worse event free survival. In FOXO1 fusion-positive RMS subtype, there was a small number of cases with altered TP53 (3 and 2 cases in the COG and UK patient cohorts, respectively), but they were universally fatal. Due to lack of a matched germline sample, it could not be determined whether the TP53 abnormalities were of somatic or germline origin. Nevertheless, both cohorts show that mutations in TP53 are associated with a poor prognosis in both fusion-negative and fusion-positive RMS, with a particularly bleak outcome in fusion-positive RMS.	34166060	PubMed	Shern et al., 2021, J Clin Oncol	4.0	accepted	1307	17	Somatic	f

The authors identified the cytogenetically cryptic NUP98/NSD1 translocation as an independent factor for dismal clinical outcome for both pediatric and adult patients. The remission rate (CR) of NUP98/NSD1-positive cases in the pediatric cohort was 100%, but 10 of the 12 cases relapsed early. The cumulative incidence of nonresponse/relapse (pCIR) at 4 years was 83 ± 13% for NUP98/NSD1-positive versus 45 ± 3% for negative cases (P < .001). NUP98/NSD1 cases had a poor event-free survival (pEFS) and overall survival (pOS) (4-years pEFS, 8 ± 8% vs 46 ± 3%, P < .001; and 4-years pOS, 31 ± 16% vs 64 ± 3%, P = .011 for NUP98/NSD1-positive vs negative cases, respectively).	21813447	PubMed	Hollink et al., 2011, Blood	4.0	accepted	2593	None	Somatic	f

IGF1R IHC was performed and patients classified as IGF1R high (n=105) or low (n=50). In IGF1R-high patients, combining metformin with exemestane was associated with significant RFS (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.57–2.23 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.73 95% CI 0.56–0.94 for exemestane only, and HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10–1.00 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.02, compared to the sequential treatment arm). There was also significant association with OS (HR for OS 1.72, 95% CI 0.96–3.08 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.03 for exemestane only, and HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.31–1.45 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.03, compared to the sequential treatment arm).

238	ALK	ALK amplifications, fusions and mutations have been shown to be driving events in non-small cell lung cancer. While crizontinib has demonstrated efficacy in treating the amplification, mutations in ALK have been shown to confer resistance to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Second-generation TKI's have seen varied success in treating these resistant cases, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has been shown to be cytostatic in ALK-altered cell lines.
207	AKT1	AKT1, also referred to as protein kinase B, is a known oncogene. AKT activation relies on the PI3K pathway, and is recognized as a critical node in the pathway. The E17 hotspot is the most characterized of AKT1 mutations, and has been shown to result in activation of the protein. Mutations in AKT1 have also been shown to confer resistance to allosteric kinase inhibitors in vitro.
369	ARAF	ARAF has recently become increasingly considered for its oncogenic potential. Its potential as a target for informing clinical action was demonstrated by a single case of advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring an S214C mutation that, when treated with sorafenib, acheived near-complete clinical remission. This finding has brought new focus on ARAF as a marker that should be assayed for in cancer treatment.
25	ABL1	ABL1 is most relevant to cancer in its role in the BCR-ABL fusion protein that has become a signature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Cells harboring this fusion have shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic outlook of the disease. However, additional mutations in ABL1 have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML.
673	BRAF	BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.  Oncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors. Class 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors. Class 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors. Class 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.
672	BRCA1	BRCA1 mutations in the germline have become a hallmark for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Variants that have been demonstrated to reduce the function of the protein have been shown to increase the risk for these cancers, as well as prostate and pancreatic cancer. These findings have been the impetus for the increased popularity of genetic testing of healthy individuals to assess risk. Recent studies in ovarian cancer have also demonstrated that BRCA mutation status can predict treatment response. A number of trials assessing BRCA mutation status have shown an improved response to platinum agents, and more recently has led to the FDA-approval of PARP inhibitors for BRCA-positive ovarian cancers. These studies have resulted in the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to recommend germline BRCA testing in all patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
675	BRCA2	BRCA2 mutations in the germline have become a hallmark for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Variants that have been demonstrated to reduce the function of the protein have been shown to increase the risk for these cancers, as well as prostate and pancreatic cancer. These findings have been the impetus for the increased popularity of genetic testing of healthy individuals to assess risk. Recent studies in ovarian cancer have also demonstrated that BRCA mutation status can predict treatment response. A number of trials assessing BRCA mutation status have shown an improved response to platinum agents, and more recently has led to the FDA-approval of PARP inhibitors for BRCA-positive ovarian cancers. These studies have resulted in the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to recommend germline BRCA testing in all patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
595	CCND1	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins, and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate, have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, but currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.
894	CCND2	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.
896	CCND3	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-ALL, a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. In a mouse study, the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of the cyclin D3 knockouts.

898	CCNE1	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its cyclin D counterparts, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma, and these measurements are correlated with later stage disease. In lung cancer, neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their more lowly expressed counterparts.
1021	CDK6	CDK6, along with its partner CDK4, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.

The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.
1029	CDKN2A	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. In majority of cases CDKN2A is inactivated by homozygous deletions. One of the mechanisms by which loss of CDKN2A can occur is by hypermethylation of the promoter region for the gene. However, the prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have suggesting poorer prognostic outcome for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator. Additionally, CDKN2A (p16) expression is a surrogate marker for HPV infection. As such, CDKN2A expression is prognostic in Oropharyngeal and probably also non-oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
1050	CEBPA	'AML with mutated CEBPA' is a provisional entity in the WHO classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is recommended to be tested for in patients with AML. CEBPA mutations are particularly associated with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). CEBPA is an intronless gene that is required for granulocyte formation in mice. N-terminal nonsense mutations result in a dominant negative C/EBP-alpha protein while C-terminal mutations reduce the DNA-binding potential of this transcription factor. CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications.
5566	PRKACA	PRKACA has been studied in breast cancer and has been found to mediate resistance to HER2 targeted therapies. It has also been found to contain a mutation hotspot that contributes to neoplastic behavior in neuroendocrine cancers. In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker for this rare subtype of HCC. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity.
1788	DNMT3A	DNMT3A is one of several epigenetic modifiers identified as recurrently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNMT3A mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal AML. In vitro experiments indicate that the R882H mutation acts in a dominant negative manner to disrupt the de novo methyltransferase activity of wildtype homotetramers. AML patient bone marrow harboring R882 mutations were similarly demonstrated to be hypomethylated compared to patients with wildtype DNMT3A. These studies also indicated that non-R882 DNMT3A mutations may act in a functionally distinct manner from R882 mutations. Alternative mechanisms indicate independent prognostic outcomes and treatment protocols may need to be considered for these two classes of DNMT3A mutations.
1956	EGFR	EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.  Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).
2064	ERBB2	ERBB2, commonly referred to as HER2, is amplified and/or overexpressed in 20-30% of invasive breast carcinomas. HER2-positive breast cancer is treated in a separate manner from other subtypes of breast cancer and commonly presents as more aggressive disease. Metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer is now commonly treated with HER2-targeted therapy. Apart from being amplified/overexpressed, ERBB2 activating mutations have been shown to have clinical importance in HER2-negative breast cancer. These mutations have shown sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib, and highlight the importance of clinical sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer.
2099	ESR1	ESR1 has been a focus in breast cancer for quite some time, but is also clinically relevant in endometrial, ovarian and other cancer types. The identification of ER-positive breast cancers that are resistant to hormone therapy have inspired clinical sequencing efforts to shed light on the mechanisms of this resistance. A number of mutations in the ligand binding domain of ESR1 have been implicated in hormone resistance and anti-estrogen therapies. These observations have spurred efforts to develop therapeutics that stimulate ESR1 protein degradation (e.g. Fulvestrant), rather than acting as a small molecule antagonist. These agents are currently in clinical trials and have seen some success.
2263	FGFR2	The FGFR proteins are involved in a wide array of pathways known to play a signficant role in cancer. Activation of these receptors can lead to activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by which FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions that lead to pathway actiation have been demonstrated to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially in lung cancer patients.

2261	FGFR3	The FGFR proteins are involved in a wide array of pathways known to play a signficant role in cancer. Activation of these receptors can lead to activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by which FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions that lead to pathway actiation have been demonstrated to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially in lung cancer patients.
2322	FLT3	FLT3 is an important cytokine receptor involved in normal hematopoiesis. Mutations in this gene are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and screening for mutations in this gene has been recommended by the World Health Organization in patients with AML, particularly in cases of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). FLT3 mutations commonly co-occur with mutations such as NPM1 that are associated with CN-AML and likely modulate prognostic impact. While FLT3-ITD mutations have been associated with poorer prognosis in AML, the prognostic impact of FLT3-TKD mutations are still up for debate.
2624	GATA2	GATA2 is a transcription factor involved in stem cell maintenance with key roles in hematopoietic development. GATA2 mutations are associated with a variety of inherited and acquired immune disorders including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition to a role in hematopoiesis, the maintenance GATA2 expression has been implicated as a requirement in KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer. Preclinical models have indicated therapeutic benefit from targeting GATA2-mediated pathways in the context of KRAS-driven NSCLC.
3417	IDH1	IDH1 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, including sarcomas, hematologic malignancies, colon cancer and brain cancer. Mutations in the two isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes involved in cytoplasmic (IDH1) and mitochondrial (IDH2) conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate have been described as mutually exclusive in many of these cancer types. The most frequent mutations involve R132 (IDH1) and R172 (IDH2) involve the active site and result in neomorphic enzyme activity. The implications of mutations in this gene vary greatly by cancer type. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 mutations have been associated with worse outcome, shorter overall survival, and normal karyotype. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Unlike the association with cytogenetically normal AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.
3418	IDH2	IDH2 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, including sarcomas, hematologic malignancies, colon cancer and brain cancer. Mutations in the two isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes involved in cytoplasmic (IDH1) and mitochondrial (IDH2) conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate have been described as mutually exclusive in many of these cancer types. The most frequent mutations involve R132 (IDH1) and R172 (IDH2) involve the active site and result in neomorphic enzyme activity. Although IDH2 (R172) mutations are associated with poorer overall prognosis in AML patients, its utility as a prognostic marker in MDS is still under debate. Additionally, IDH2 (R140) has been associated with improved overall survival in AML. IDH2 mutations have been associated with improved prognosis in gliomas.
3717	JAK2	JAK2 is a kinase that is misregulated or mutated in a number of myeloproliferative diseases and cancers. The mutation V617F is the most clinically relevant variant, and is seen in around half of myeloproliferative disorders. The variant is a known activating mutation, and activated JAK2 is sufficient to drive myeloproliferative disorders in mouse models. V617F, while most recurrent, is not the only mechanism by which JAK2 can be activated in patients. JAK2 is now one of the first diagnostic markers tested upon diagnosis with a myeloproliferative disorder.
3815	KIT	c-KIT activation has been shown to have oncogenic activity in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), melanomas, lung cancer, and other tumor types. The targeted therapeutics nilotinib and sunitinib have shown efficacy in treating KIT overactive patients, and are in late-stage trials in melanoma and GIST. KIT overactivity can be the result of many genomic events from genomic amplification to overexpression to missense mutations. Missense mutations have been shown to be key players in mediating clinical response and acquired resistance in patients being treated with these targeted therapeutics.
3845	KRAS	Mutations in the RAS family of proteins are frequently observed across cancer types. The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.
5604	MAP2K1	MAP2K1 is a dual-specificity kinase known for it's involvement in the ERK pathway by activation of ERK1 and ERK2. MAP2K1 activating mutations have been observed in a number of cancers including ovarian,  melanoma and lung. These activating mutations are generally found in the N-terminal negative regulatory region or the ATP-binding region of the N-terminal lobe.  Inhibitors of MEK genes have been shown to inhibit tumor growth in these cases.
4209	MEF2D	None
1436	CSF1R	None
4255	MGMT	None
4869	NPM1	AML with mutated NPM1 is a provisional entity in the WHO classification of AML and is recommended to be tested in patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). FLT3 mutations should be evaluated concurrently as they have prognostic consequences. NPM1 mutations are concentrated in exon 12, most frequently W288fs which results in cytoplasmic sequestration of the protein. Exon 12 NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD are associated with good prognostic outcomes. Mice expressing the Npm1-W288fs mutation develop myeloproliferative neoplasms but not overt leukemia, indicating it may require additional mutations to promote leukemic development.

4893	NRAS	Mutations in the RAS family of proteins have frequently been observed across cancer types. The amino acid positions G12, G13 and Q61 account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations. The isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, targeting these RAS mutants has also been very elusive, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.
5290	PIK3CA	PIK3CA is the most recurrently mutated gene in breast cancer, and has been found to important in a number of cancer types. An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.
5156	PDGFRA	Commonly mutated in GI tract tumors, PDGFR family genes (mutually exclusive to KIT mutations) are a hallmark of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Gene fusions involving the PDGFRA kinase domain are highly correlated with eosinophilia, and the WHO classifies myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with these characteristics as a distinct disorder. Mutations in the 842 region of PDGFRA have been often found to confer resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib.
5371	PML	The PML-RARA fusion is the result of a recurrent, balanced translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, denoted as t(15;17)(q22;q12), and a diagnostic event in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown sensitivity to ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) in APL patients harboring the PML-RARA fusion. Recent interest has been shown in combining ATRA and arsenic trioxide for treating these patients, and early results seem promising. However, newly discovered mutations in the B2 domain of PML have started to show conferred resistance to ATRA in these patients.
5728	PTEN	PTEN is a multi-functional tumor suppressor that is very commonly lost in human cancer. Observed in prostate cancer, glioblastoma, endometrial, lung and breast cancer to varying degrees. Up to 70% of prostate cancer patients have been observed to have loss of expression of the gene. It is a part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and mTOR inhibitors have been relatively ineffective in treating patients with PTEN loss. New appoaches using microRNAs are currently being investigated.
5979	RET	RET mutations and the RET fusion RET-PTC lead to activation of this tyrosine kinase receptor and are associated with thyroid cancers. RET point mutations are the most common mutations identified in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with germline and somatic mutations in RET associated with hereditary and sporadic forms, respectively. The most common somatic form mutation is M918T (exon 16) and a variety of other mutations effecting exons 10, 11 and 15 have been described. The prognostic significance of these mutations have been hotly debated in the field, however, data suggests that some RET mutation may confer drug resistence. No RET-specific agents are currently clinically available but several promiscuous kinase inhibitors that target RET, among others, have been approved for MTC treatment.
861	RUNX1	RUNX1 is a transcription factor that forms a complex with the cofactor CBFB. This complex provides stability to the RUNX1 protein which is involved in the generation of hematopoietic stem cells and for their differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lines.  Loss of RUNX1 function has been shown to impair differentiation between myeloid and lymphoid lines often resulting in the development of leukemia.
23451	SF3B1	SF3B1 mutations have been described in several myeloid malignancies, predominantly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as other hematologic malignancies, breast cancer, and uveal melanoma (UM). SF3B1 is one of several genes involved in RNA splicing that has been identified as recurrently mutated in MDS and other malignanices. The mutations affecting SF3B1 are typically heterozygous, point mutations suspected to be functionally deleterious with R625 and K700E described as a major mutation hotspots. MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations have been reported to have better overall and event-free survival than their wildtype counterparts. Additionally, these mutations are highly associated with subtypes of MDS characterized by ringed sideroblasts (refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts). In UM patients, SF3B1 mutations have been reported to be associated with chromosome 3 disomy, which defines a subgroup with low risk of metastasis.
7157	TP53	TP53 mutations are universal across cancer types. The loss of a tumor suppressor is most often through large deleterious events, such as frameshift mutations, or premature stop codons. In TP53 however, many of the observed mutations in cancer are found to be single nucleotide missense variants. These variants are broadly distributed throughout the gene, but with the majority localizing in the DNA binding domain. There is no single hotspot in the DNA binding domain, but a majority of mutations occur in amino acid positions 175, 245, 248, 273, and 282 (NM_000546) (Olivier et al., 2010). To fulfill its proper biological function four TP53 polypeptides must form a tetramer which functions as a transcription factor, therefore even if one out of four polypeptides has inactivating mutation it may lead to dominant negative phenotype of variable degree. While a large proportion of cancer genomics research is focused on somatic variants, TP53 is also of note in the germline. Germline TP53 mutations are the hallmark of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and many (both germline and somatic) variants have been found to have a prognostic impact on patient outcomes. The significance of many polymorphisms for susceptibility and prognosis of disease is still very much up for debate.
7248	TSC1	None
7249	TSC2	None
7307	U2AF1	U2AF1 is one of several spliceosome complex genes frequently mutated in a variety of hematologic malignancies, particularly de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as solid tumors such as lung and pancreatic cancers. Two hotspot mutations (S34 and Q157) occur within the two zinc-finger domains of the U2AF1 protein. These mutations have been associated with altered splicing patterns in vitro and in vivo. U2AF1 mutations in MDS have been associated with an increased risk of transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia, however, the impact of these mutations on overall survival has been an area of debate.
7490	WT1	WT1 is a tumor suppressor gene associated with the development of Wilms' Tumor, from which it was named. Mutations in exon 7 and 9 of WT1 have been recurrently identified in acute myeloid leukemia and associated with poorer prognosis and chemotherapy resistance.
5155	PDGFB	None
5159	PDGFRB	None
5243	ABCB1	None
4851	NOTCH1	NOTCH1 is one of four known genes encoding the NOTCH family of proteins, a group of receptors involved in the Notch signaling pathway. NOTCH proteins are characterized by N-terminal EGF-like repeats followed by LNR domains which form a complex with ligands to prevent signaling. The Notch signaling pathway is involved in processes related to cell fate specification, differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Activation of Notch has been shown to be correlative with mammary tumorgenesis in mice and increased expression of Notch receptors has been observed in a variety of cancer types including cervical, colon, head and neck, lung, renal, pancreatic, leukemia, and breast cancer. A number of treatment modalities have been explored related to Notch inhibition especially in breast cancer with mixed results.
4921	DDR2	None
4233	MET	Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition MET is a prototypical receptor tyrosine kinase. Its ligand is Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). MET alterations are drivers of human cancer.  Amplification and resulting overexpression has been reported in several cancers, and make the receptor's activity independent of HGF. Gene fusions also decouple kinase activity from the cell membrane and render it constitutively active.  Finally, exclusion of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain of the kinase by "skipping" of exon 14 activates the kinase.
2313	FLI1	None
2130	EWSR1	Fusions between EWSR1 and multiple 3` partners are regularly identified in soft tissue sarcomas and can aid in differential diagnosis. The fusion product usually contains the N-terminal transcription-activating domain of EWSR1 and the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of the fusion partner, generating a novel transcription factor.

7428	VHL	Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by heterozygous germline mutation in VHL gene on chromosome 3p. Patients are predisposed to developing hemangioblastomas of the brain, spinal cord, and retina; renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cysts and neuroendocrine tumors; endolymphatic sac tumors; and epididymal and broad ligament cysts. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be associated with headache, vomiting, gait disturbances, or ataxia. Spinal hemangioblastomas and related syrinx usually present with pain. Sensory and motor loss may develop with cord compression. Retinal hemangioblastomas may be the initial manifestation of VHL disease and can cause vision loss. Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with VHL and is the leading cause of mortality. Pheochromocytomas can be asymptomatic but may cause sustained or episodic hypertension. Pancreatic lesions often remain asymptomatic and rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Endolymphatic sac tumors can cause hearing loss of varying severity, which can be a presenting symptom. Cystadenomas of the epididymis are relatively common. They rarely cause problems, unless bilateral, in which case they may result in infertility.  The VHL gene product encodes pVHL, which binds to elongin C, elongin B, cullin-2 and Rbx1. This complex catalyzes the polyubiquitinylation of specific proteins and targets them for degradation by proteosomes. For example, under normoxic conditions, hydroxylated hypoxia-inducble factor alpha subunits (HIFα) binds pVHL targets HIFα for degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF1α is not hydroxylated, pVHL does not bind, and HIF1α subunits accumulate. HIF1α forms heterodimers with HIF1β and activates transcription of a variety of hypoxia-inducible genes (i.e., VEGF, EPO, TGFα, PDGFβ). Likewise, when pVHL is absent or mutated, HIF1α subunits accumulate, resulting in cell proliferation and the neovascularization of tumors characteristic of VHL disease.  Pathogenic variants in VHL either prevent its expression (i.e., deletions, frameshifts, nonsense mutations, and splice site mutations) or lead to the expression of an abnormal protein (i.e., missense mutations). Missense mutations that destabilize packing of the alpha-helical domains, decrease the stability of the alpha-beta domain interface, interfere with binding of elongin C and HIF1α, or disrupt hydrophobic core residues result in loss of HIF regulation and are more likely to result in VHL type 1 (no predisposition to pheochromocytoma).  Missense mutations that result in pVHL that is normal with respect to HIF regulation are more likely to be associated with VHL with clinical pheochromocytoma.   Acquired somatic pathogenic variants in VHL may give rise to sporadic VHL-type tumors (i.e., clear cell RCC and hemangioblastoma) without other associated tumors characteristic of the hereditary disease. It should be noted that >90% of the most common form of kidney cancer (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) are associated with bi-allelic somatic mutation in the VHL gene, and is the rationale for the anti-angiogenic therapy for RCC patients.

472	ATM	Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a recessive disorder resulting from germline mutation of the A-T mutated (ATM) gene on chromosome 11q. Upon sensing double-stranded breaks (DSB), the wild-type kinase encoded by ATM initiates the DNA-damage response by phosphorylating histone H2AX and, subsequently, various other proteins, such as BRCA1 and the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 (MRN) complex, which are recruited to the damaged site. Additionally, ATM phosphorylates p53, resulting in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and leading to senescence or apoptosis. Somatic variants can result in inhibition or loss of these functions and can cause resistance to therapies that rely on inducing apoptosis via DSBs. Germline variants in A-T patients result in a predisposition to cancer, most frequently hematologic or breast. PARP inhibition has been studied for its potential in treating ATM mutated breast cancer patients.
8314	BAP1	BAP1 is a deubiquitylase thought to be a key regulator of many cancer-associated pathways. Germline alterations in BAP1 have been characterized as predisposing variants to familial melanocytic skin tumors. These alterations also have been linked to the development of mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma and others. Clinically, the role of BAP1 is still being investigated. However, the development of intradermal tumors known as melanocytic BAP1-associated intradermal tumors (MBAITs) are enough for a patient to be subject to more intense surveillance to catch other malignancies as early as possible.

7849	PAX8	PAX8 is one of nine transcription factors within the PAX gene family. It has been observed to be expressed during embryonic development however expression attenuates after development in all but a few tissues. Research has indicated that over-expression of PAX proteins in general are not an initiating event in tumorgenesis however they may facilitate malignant development. PAX8 is expressed in 80-96% of all High-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) and is commonly used as a marker for the disease. In addition PAX8 has become a useful biomarker for differentiating between mullerian mucinous and non-mullerian tumors. PAX8 has also been associated with neoplasms in the kidney and thyroid.

2066	ERBB4	ErbB4 (HER4) is one of the four members in the EGFR subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. Ligands include EGF, epiregulin, betacellulin and the neuregulins (Sundvall et. al.). Of these, NRG3 and NRG4 exclusively bind HER4 (Hynes et. al.).  Mutations in ERBB4 have been identified in various cancer types including melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma and medulloblastoma. A therapeutic value of these aberrations still remains unknown (Arteaga et. al.).
2067	ERCC1	None
2068	ERCC2	ERCC2 functions as a DNA repair gene involved in separating the double helix via 5’-3’ helicase activity. It forms a part of the transcription factor II Human (TFIIH) complex and is ATP-dependent. The TFIIH complex is known to be involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) which can repair DNA damage caused by chemotherapeutic treatment and basal transcription. ERCC2 variants have been observed in a variety of cancers. A number of studies have suggested ERCC2 variants can act as biomarkers to predict response to neoadjuvant treatment, and cancer prognosis. Additionally the Lys751Gln polymorphism has been observed to increase risk in a number of cancer types; however, results have been conflicting.

2248	FGF3	FGF3 is a member of the basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) gene family and was first identified  based on it's similarity to the mouse proto-oncogene int-2. Amplifications of this gene and the surrounding region (11q13) have been observed in various cancers including breast cancer, esophogeal cancer, melanoma, bladder cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Lower tumor grade and stage have been associated with FGF3 amplifications in HCC; however, this event is fairly rare in this tumor type.
2258	FGF13	None
2260	FGFR1	FGFR1 is a member of the Fibroblast Growth Factor family, comprising of 4 receptors and 18 Ligands.  FGFR1 signalling downstream functions mainly via PI3K and MAPK pathways (Turner et. al.). Several ways of involvement of FGFR1 in cancer have been proposed: auto- and paracrine activation, amplification and overexpression (Marshall et. al,  Weiss et. al.,  Cheng et. al.). Especially amplification of FGFR1 in lung cancer is an emerging treatment target with clinical studies currently ongoing (e.g. NCT01004224). However, FGFR1 amplification does not always correlate with protein expression and predictive biomarkers still remain to be defined in clinic (von Mässenhausen et. al.). Mutation of FGFR1 seems to be less common, but has been described in glioblastoma, pilocytic astrocytomas and Ewing's sarcoma (Rand et. al., Jones et. al., Agelopoulos et. al.).

2475	MTOR	mTOR deregulation has been observed in many cancer types. As a part of the PI3K/Akt pathway, there is a broad interest in mTOR biology across cancer types. mTOR inhibition has been investigated for nearly a decade. Everolimus, temsirolimus and zotarolimus are three of the more commonly used mTOR inhibitors used in clinical treatment today, with modest success.

6098	ROS1	ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently involved in genetic rearrangement in a variety of human cancers (e.g. NSCLC, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, angiosarcoma...). The resulting fusion protein harbors the constitutively active ROS1 kinase domain and drives cellular proliferation (Davies et. al.). In NSCLC about 1% harbor a ROS1 rearrangement. These patients are predominantely female and have a lower T-stage (Warth et. al.). Treatment with crizotinib leads to a reported objective response rate of appr. 70% and a median duration of response of 18 months (Shaw et. al.). Resistance mechanisms to crizotinib have been described and involve mutations in the kinase domain. More selective inhibitors of ROS1 might overcome this resistance (Davare et. al.).

PD1 expression has been observed in a variety of cancers including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. The interaction of PD1/PDL1 is hypothesized to be a possible mechanism for the tumor to escape immune response. A number of checkpoint blockade inhibitors including pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been developed that target the PD1/PDL1 interaction in order to allow T-cells to recognize tumor cells without being deactivated by the tumor.

1	BCR::ABL	The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome, is one of the most studied fusion genes in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.	23522397.0	23632600.0	None	None	ENST00000305877.8	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	255.5	None	None	T(9;22)(Q34;Q11),BCR-ABL1,BCR-ABL
2	BCR::ABL T315I	While the efficacy of imatinib has revolutionized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, it is still not a cure-all. Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of selection have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation T315I (aka T334I) has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib. Second generation TKI's (dasatinib and ponatinib) specific to BCR-ABL have shown efficacy in treating resistant cases.	133748283.0	133748283.0	C	T	ENST00000318560.5	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant,transcript_fusion	NM_007313.2:c.1001C>T,NP_005148.2:p.Thr315Ile,ENST00000372348.2:c.1001C>T,NC_000009.11:g.133748283C>T	146.0	CA122575	12624	THR334ILE,RS121913459,BCR-ABL THR315ILE,BCR-ABL1 T315I,BCR-ABL1 THR315ILE,BCR-ABL T315I

Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of selection have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation E255K has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib.

4	E17K	AKT1 E17K is a recurrent mutation that has been observed in breast, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancer. It has been convincingly shown to be an activating mutation resulting in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity. It has been suggested that this mutation decreases the cell's sensitivity to AKT1 allosteric kinase inhibitors. This, and other AKT1 mutations, are the subject of much research and development for therapeutics.	105246551.0	105246551.0	C	T	ENST00000407796.2	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	NC_000014.8:g.105246551C>T,NM_001014432.1:c.49G>A,NP_001014432.1:p.Glu17Lys,ENST00000407796.2:c.49G>A	33.5	CA123660	13983	GLU17LYS,RS34409589
5	EML4::ALK	The EML4-ALK fusion variant 1 consisting of ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) fused to EML4 exons 1-13 is the most common EML4-ALK variant, and was discovered in non-small cell lung cancer. Multiple EML4 breakpoint shave been described with differential sensitivity to inhibitors with variant 1 showing greater sensitivity than 3a in cell lines. EML4-ALK is crizotinib sensitive; however, several mutations that confer resistance mutations have been described in case studies. In the only clinical trial for crizotinib that included determination of EML4-ALK variant type in a subset of its participants, a very high response rate was observed, although the numbers were insufficient to validate correlation of variant type to outcome. Preclinical studies with this variant have indicated sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors.	42396490.0	42522656.0	None	None	ENST00000318522.5	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	38.0	None	None	EML4-ALK
6	EML4::ALK C1156Y	In patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibiting EML4-ALK fusion, C1156Y has been shown to confer resistance to crizotinib. Case reports indicate that secondary mutations can modulate drug sensitivity. EML4-ALK C1156Y/L1196M maintained crizotinib resistance while the lorlatinib resistant combination EML4-ALK C1156Y/L1198F re-sensitized the tumor to crizotinib treatment.	29445258.0	29445258.0	C	T	ENST00000389048.3	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant,transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3:c.3467G>A,NC_000002.11:g.29445258C>T,NM_004304.4:c.3467G>A,NP_004295.2:p.Cys1156Tyr	29.0	CA16602783	376340	EML4-ALK CYS1156TYR,RS1057519859,EML4-ALK C1156Y
7	EML4::ALK L1196M	In patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibiting EML4-ALK fusion, L1196M has been shown to confer resistance to crizotinib. This was also true in a patient with both EML4-ALK C1156Y & L1196M.	29443631.0	29443631.0	G	T	ENST00000389048.3	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant,transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3:c.3586C>A,NC_000002.11:g.29443631G>T,NM_004304.4:c.3586C>A,NP_004295.2:p.Leu1196Met	21.0	CA16602593	376135	EML4-ALK LEU1196MET,RS1057519784,EML4-ALK L1196M
8	F1174L	ALK F1174L has been observed as recurrent in neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and other cancer types. Neuroblastoma cells containing this mutation have shown resistance to low doses of criztonib. However, increased dosage can overcome this resistance in cell lines studies. TAE684 has also proven effective in both NSCLC and neuroblastoma F1174L containing cells.	29443695.0	29443695.0	G	T	ENST00000389048.3	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	NM_004304.4:c.3522C>A,NP_004295.2:p.Phe1174Leu,NC_000002.11:g.29443695G>T,ENST00000389048.3:c.3522C>A	33.5	CA279586	217851	PHE1174LEU,RS863225281
9	R1275Q	ALK R1275Q has been observed as a recurrent mutation in  neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as other cancer types.

10	S214C	ARAF S214C has been found to be a recurrent oncogenic mutation in non-small cell lung cancer. It has been shown to confer sensitivity to sorafenib and trametenib in cell lines. In a case study of advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma harboring this mutation, sorafenib also acheived near-complete clinical remission. This case has brought more interest to the variant from a research and clinical perspective.	47426121.0	47426121.0	C	G	ENST00000377045.4	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	NC_000023.10:g.47426121C>G,NM_001654.4:c.641C>G,NP_001645.1:p.Ser214Cys,ENST00000377045.4:c.641C>G	11.0	CA16602595	376137	SER214CYS,RS1057519786

12	V600E	BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.	140453136.0	140453136.0	A	T	ENST00000288602.6	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	NM_004333.4:c.1799T>A,NP_004324.2:p.Val600Glu,NC_000007.13:g.140453136A>T,ENST00000288602.6:c.1799T>A	1303.5	CA123643	376069,13961	RS113488022,VAL600GLU,V640E,VAL640GLU

20	Overexpression	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	69455855.0	69469242.0	None	None	ENST00000227507.2	75.0	GRCh37	None	None	116.0	None	None	None

23	LOSS	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. Treating cyclin D3 knockout mice with the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of a Notch-driven model of T-ALL.	41902671.0	41909586.0	None	None	ENST00000372991.4	75.0	GRCh37	loss_of_function_variant	None	3.0	None	None	None
24	Overexpression	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its counterpart, cyclin D, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, are correlated with later stage disease and have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.	30302805.0	30315215.0	None	None	ENST00000262643.3	75.0	GRCh37	None	None	62.0	None	None	None

25	EXPRESSION	CDK4, along with its partner CDK6, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.	58141510.0	58146304.0	None	None	ENST00000257904.6	75.0	GRCh37	None	None	8.0	None	None	None
27	Promoter Hypermethylation	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter region. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.	21974827.0	21994591.0	None	None	ENST00000498124.1	75.0	GRCh37	None	None	15.0	None	None	None
28	N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT	CEBPA N-terminal frame shift mutations that result in a premature stop codon are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis; however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications. N-terminal frame shift mutations within amino acids 1-120 have been shown to disrupt expression of the full-length 42kDa isoform while maintaining expression of a 30kDa isoform (translated from the AUG at full-length protein isoform amino acid M120). This 30kDa isoform exhibits dominant negative activity.	33792961.0	33793470.0	None	None	ENST00000498907.2	75.0	GRCh37	frameshift_truncation,dominant_negative_variant	None	3.0	None	None	None

In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity. The presence of this fusion may be used as a diagnostic marker for this rare tumor type.	14628951.0	14629232.0	None	None	ENST00000254322.2	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	75.0	None	None	DNAJB1-PRKACA
32	R882	DNMT3A R882 mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) with R882H as the most common form. Mutations in DNMT3A have largely been associated with poorer prognosis, however this is not consistent across all studies. This may be a result of patient age or combining R882 and non-R882 mutations during analysis as studies have indicated independent mechanisms of action and differential prognostic implications for these mutation types. One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.	25457241.0	25457243.0	None	None	ENST00000264709.3	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	None	510.0	None	375882,375883,375884,375879,375880,375881	R693,ARG882,ARG693
33	L858R	EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer, and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.	55259515.0	55259515.0	T	G	ENST00000275493.2	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	NC_000007.13:g.55259515T>G,NM_005228.4:c.2573T>G,ENST00000275493.2:c.2573T>G,NP_005219.2:p.Leu858Arg	375.0	CA126713	376280,376282,16609	LEU858ARG,RS121434568
34	T790M	EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.	55249071.0	55249071.0	C	T	ENST00000275493.2	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	ENST00000275493.2:c.2369C>T,NM_005228.4:c.2369C>T,NP_005219.2:p.Thr790Met,NC_000007.13:g.55249071C>T	386.25	CA090928	16613	THR790MET,RS121434569

55	ITD	FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.	28608219.0	28608351.0	None	None	ENST00000241453.7	75.0	GRCh37	inframe_insertion	None	445.5	None	16270	None

They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations.

86	EXON 12 MUTATION	NPM1 exon 12 mutations are frequently identified in patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and often co-occur with FLT3-ITD. FLT3 status should also be evaluated as co-occurence with FLT3-ITD may impact prognosis. Exon 12 mutations have been identified as a predictor of good prognostic outcomes in the absence of FLT3-ITD. Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy. Cytoplasmic sequestration of NPM1 (NPM1c) is associated with a good response to induction therapy.	170837531.0	170837569.0	None	None	ENST00000517671.1	75.0	GRCh37	exon_variant	None	454.0	None	None	None

173	EML4::ALK T1151INST	The ALK fusion variant with insertion of T at amino acid 1151 was found in an ALK rearranged lung adenocarcinoma which had progressed after responding to crizotinib treatment. The mutation was absent in tumor sample taken before crizotinib treatment. Characterization of the variant using cell lines expressing EML4-ALK with 1151 T insert found the variant to be highly crizotinib resistant, and other work demonstrated resistance to next generation inhibitor alectinib, while resistance to tool compound TAE684 indicates potential resistance to the next generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib which is derived from TAE684. Other experiments suggest theraputic potential for HSP90 inhibitors, as EML4-ALK T1151 Tins sensitivity to 17-AAG has been observed.	29445271.0	29445272.0	None	CGT	ENST00000389048.3	75.0	GRCh37	inframe_insertion,transcript_fusion	NC_000002.11:g.29445271_29445272insCGT	18.0	CA645528802	None	T1151_L1152INST,EML4-ALK T1151INST

183	Mutation	BAP1 is a tumor suppressor gene, mutations in this gene have been observed in a number of cancers including melanoma, and renal cancers. These mutations generally lead to loss-of-function and mutations in the UHC domain of BAP1 have been shown to lead to structural instability and β-amyloid aggregation in models. Germline mutations are associated with an increased risk of tumorgenesis and can lead to the development of "atypical Spitz tumours (ASTs), cutaneous melanoma (CM), epithelioid malignant mesothelioma (MM) and clear cell RCC".	52435029.0	52444366.0	None	None	ENST00000460680.1	75.0	GRCh37	protein_altering_variant,loss_of_function_variant	None	73.5	None	None	None

189	Mutation	DNMT3A mutations occur in a variety of myeloid malignancies. These mutations are associated with adverse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in the context of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations, which often co-occur. Early results indicate AML patients with DNMT3A mutations may respond better to decitabine than those with wild-type. Shorter survival has been indicated in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, however, larger cohorts are required to verify this finding. DNMT3A mutations have been suggested as a pre-leukemic lesion and found in older individuals with clonal hematopoiesis but no overt malignancy.	25455845.0	25565459.0	None	None	ENST00000264709.3	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_variant	None	115.0	None	None	None

194	EWSR1::ERG	EWSR1-ERG is found in 5% of patients with Ewing Sarcoma and considered to be diagnostic of this disease, a small tumor more often found in bone, but less frequently in soft tissue. To better identify EWSR1-ERG in patients, conventional cytogenetics methods were analyzed: FISH and RT-PCR. Ultimately concluding that more than one method is needed to accurately diagnose patients due to the strengths and weaknesses of each individual method.	29664007.0	29683123.0	None	None	ENST00000397938.2	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	25.0	None	None	EWSR1-ERG

199	R172	IDH2 R172 is a gain-of-function mutation commonly observed in acute myeloid leukemia and is enriched in those patients which are cytogenetically normal. R172 is analogous to IDH1 R132 mutations and leads to neomorphic enzymatic activity. Specifically this mutation "catalyzes the conversion of alpha ketoglurarate to beta-hydrozyglutarate" leading to increased levels of beta-hydrozyglutarate. This in turn leads to hypermethylation of target genes and an inhibition of cellular differentiation. R172 mutations generally lead to worse overall survival and higher rates of relapse compared to the most common IDH2 mutations in AML (R140).	90631837.0	90631839.0	None	None	ENST00000330062.3	75.0	GRCh37	protein_altering_variant	None	105.0	None	None	ARG172
200	DELETION	IKZF1 deletions have been reported in a variety of cancer types including pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, T-cell ALL as well as solid tumors of the large intestine, lung, and liver. The clinical impact of these deletions is unknown for many cancer types however a poor outcome has been observed in leukemia based disease. This gene has been strongly implicated as a regulator for "normal  hematopoiesis". In regards to BCP ALL, mouse models have shown that mutations in IKZF1 are not sufficient in and of themselves to cause disease.  Haploinsuffeciency in combination with BCR-ABL1 however, will accelerate leukemiagenesis possibly indicating that at least in regards to BCP ALL these are secondary events that may be necessary for the development of leukaemic clones.	50344378.0	50472799.0	None	None	ENST00000331340.3	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_ablation	None	120.0	None	None	None

220	Promoter Mutation	TERT promoter mutations are activating and commonly found at two hotspots within the TERT promoter region which occur 124 and 146 base pairs (hg19) upstream of the translation start site. These hotspots, termed C228T and C250T are observed in many cancer types and have a particularly high prevalence in glioblastoma (83%), melanoma (71%), bladder cancer (66%) and hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) (47%). The two mutations are usually heterozygous and mutually exclusive and result in an increased similarity to an ETS binding domain and may act as a binding site to an ETS transcription factor. These mutations are thought to be early events in tumorgenesis and aid in cellular immortality. Decreased overall survival in patients with these mutations have been observed in medulloblastoma, thyroid cancer, urogenital cancer, melanoma, and laryngeal tumors. The presence of these mutations has also been shown to be predictive of malignant/premalignant nodules in HCC and meningiomas.	1295161.0	1295373.0	None	None	ENST00000310581.5	75.0	GRCh37	regulatory_region_variant	None	105.0	None	None	-124C>T,-146C>T

267	Amplification	FGFR1 amplifications are the most common aberrations of the FGFR family in cancer. One study reports FGFR1 aberrations in 3.5% of 4,853 patients of which most are FGFR1 amplifications (Helsten et. al., 2016). Preclinically, FGFR1 amplifications have also been shown to confer sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors (Weiss et. al., 2010). Clinical studies are currently ongoing (e.g. NCT01004224).	38268656.0	38325363.0	None	None	ENST00000425967.3	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_amplification	None	170.5	None	None	None
268	Expression	FGFR1 high expression has been reported in 11.8% (178 patients) of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, and was enriched in early stages (Freier et. al., 2007). Another study reports FGFR1 expression in 35% of primary HNSSC (353 patients) (Göke et. al., 2015). In both studies, FGFR1 gene amplification and expression do not correlate well with about 35% of samples with FGFR1 amplification overexpressing FGFR1 (Göke et. al., 2015). FGFR1 expression also correlated with sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors in preclinical models of lung cancer (Wynes et. al., 2014), HNSSC (Göke et. al., 2015) and urothelial carcinoma (Lamont et. al., 2011).	38268656.0	38325363.0	None	None	ENST00000425967.3	75.0	GRCh37	None	None	46.0	None	None	None
269	REARRANGEMENT	ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that frequently forms gene fusions in several cancer types. Approximately 2% of NSCLC patients harbor a ROS1 gene fusion. Several fusion partners have been described with a constant ROS1-breakpoint, maintaining the kinase domain (Solomon B, 2015). Following case-studies and retrospective analyses, an expansion cohort of a phase-1 study showed clinical benefit of crizotinib in ROS1 rearranged NSCLC. The benefit was independent of the type of ROS1-rearrangement (Shaw et. al.,2014).	117609463.0	117747018.0	None	None	ENST00000368508.3	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	108.0	None	None	None

272	p16 Expression	CDKN2A (p16) expression is a surrogate marker of HPV infection in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. CDKN2A and p53 are inactivated through HPV proteins E6 and E7 and therefore not altered in expression level in HPV-associated carcinomas. However, there is no perfect overlap between p16 expression and HPV status with some 10-12.5% of HPV-negative tumors expressing p16. (Seiwert, T JCO, 2014). p16 positivity is a well-established positive prognostic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the primary and, as increasing evidence suggests, recurrent/metastatic disease settings. Predictive information from HPV status have not been established to date. A lack of benefit from EGFR-inhibitors has been proposed by some studies. Other studies were not able to reproduce this finding.	21968055.0	21974865.0	None	None	ENST00000498124.1	75.0	GRCh37	None	None	180.0	None	None	None

306	Amplification	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.	37856333.0	37884915.0	None	None	ENST00000269571.5	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_amplification	None	883.0	None	None	OVEREXPRESSION

311	Mutation	PIK3CA mutations are observed in many cancers among the most prevalent are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. These mutations have been observed in up to 40%, 20%, and 21% respectively for each of these cancer types with mutations commonly occurring within the helical exon 9 and kinase domain of exon 20. In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC. Interestingly PIK3CA mutations in HNSCC have been observed to be absent from a number of ethnic groups including greek, german, and vietnamese populations.	178866311.0	178957881.0	None	None	ENST00000263967.3	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_variant,gain_of_function_variant	None	454.0	None	None	None
312	VIII	The EGFRvIII variant is an oncogenic mutation that has been reported in several cancers including glioblastoma multiforme, breast, lung, head and neck, ovarian and prostate. In high-grade gliomas, EGFRvIII has been reported in about 30% of cases with EGFR amplification. The EGFRvIII mutation leads to deletion of the receptor ectodomain exons 2-7. The presence of this variant has been linked with clinical response to EGFR TKI.

414	Y772_A775DUP	Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain occur at a 2-4% frequency in lung adenocarcinomas, the majority of which are in exon 20 as in-frame duplications or insertions in a small 8 codon region (774-781 or 775-782). These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.	37880996.0	37880997.0	None	TACGTGATGGCT	ENST00000269571.5	75.0	GRCh37	inframe_insertion	NM_001005862.2:c.2224_2235dupTACGTGATGGCT,ENST00000269571.5:c.2314_2325dupTACGTGATGGCT,NC_000017.10:g.37880985_37880996dupTACGTGATGGCT,NC_000017.10:g.37880993_37880994insGCTTACGTGATG	36.0	CA135369	44985	A775INSYVMA,P.A775_G776INSYVMA,P.E770_A771INSAYVM,TYR772_ALA775DUP,A775_G776INSYVMA,M774INSAYVM

420	R132H	IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	209113112.0	209113112.0	C	T	ENST00000415913.1	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	NM_001282386.1:c.395G>A,NP_005887.2:p.Arg132His,NC_000002.11:g.209113112C>T,ENST00000415913.1:c.395G>A	9.0	CA170874	156444	ARG132HIS,RS121913500

431	CBFB::MYH11	CBFB-MYH11 is the result of inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q22) and is sufficient for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (in the correct setting) according to WHO criteria, even when blast counts are <20% (Vardiman et al, Blood 2008). This fusion is typically associated with favorable prognosis relative to other AML subtypes (including cytogenetically normal); however, the impact of additional mutations in the context of this fusion is incompletely understood. AMLs with this fusion are often grouped with other rearrangements affecting genes encoding core binding factor subunits, referred to as CBF AMLs.	67063148.0	67116211.0	None	None	ENST00000412916.2	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	20.0	None	None	INV(16)(P13.1;Q22),T(16;16)(P13.1;Q22),CBFB-MYH11

In the same paper, this mutation (along with other ERBB2 activating mutations) in murine Ba/F3 cells have been shown to be sensitive to the ERBB2 inhibitors (afatinib, lapatinib and neratinib). More recent evidence may show that HER2 acitivating mutations confer sensitivity to a host of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which is the topic of current clinical trials and research.	37868208.0	37868208.0	None	None	ENST00000269571.5	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	ENST00000269571.5:c.929C>T,NC_000017.10:g.37868208C>T	4.0	None	376188,376189	None

499	Fusion	Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.	29415640.0	29446394.0	None	None	ENST00000389048.3	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	648.0	None	None	REARRANGEMENT
500	EML4::ALK e20-e20	EML4-ALK variant 2 consists of a fusion of the ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) with EML4 exons 1-20. Variant 2 has cytoplasmic distribution and makes up ~10% of EML4-ALK fusions found in NSCLC,. Although the specific variant is not consistently reported, single cases demonstrating response to crizotinib treatment in NSCLC and a differentiated malignant neoplasm of unknown origin have been reported. In vitro, this variant has shown greater sensitivity to ALK inhibition with TAE684 and crizotinib than the EML4-ALK variants 1 (E13;A20), 3a (E6;A20) and 3b (E6ins33;A20). The variant was reported to be less stable in cells than other variants, and may be a client protein of Hsp90. Along these lines the variant has shown preclinical sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition.	42396490.0	42552694.0	None	None	ENST00000318522.5	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	16.5	None	None	EML4-ALK E20-E20

503	EML4::ALK e6-e20	The EML4-ALK variant 3a consists of the ALK kinase domain fused to EML4 exons 1-6, while the 3b variant has an additional 33bp of intronic EML4 sequence between EML4 and ALK regions. The two variants were found to originate from a single genomic rearrangement, and 3a/3b is found in ~ 30% of EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. Variant 3a has cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. In vitro, these variants have shown sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib but less sensitive than other EML4-ALK variants. The H2228 cell line contains 3a and 3b variants and is described as having cyctostatic response to ALK inhibition as opposed to apoptotic. In a study of 31 NSCLC patients with EML4-ALK rearrangements, 4/5 patients with the 3a variant showed a partial response while 1 showed progressive disease (the only PD observed). In cells the 3a variant was reported to be more stable than other variants, less sensitive to crizotinib and not to respond to Hsp90 inhibition.	42396490.0	42491871.0	None	None	ENST00000318522.5	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	25.0	None	None	EML4-ALK E6-E20

In vitro kinase activity, structural predictions and growth inhibition assays indicate the L2026M mutation in the CD74-ROS1 fusion provides crizotinib resistance. Additional preclinical assays have indicated that crizotinib resistant cells harboring this mutation are sensitive to PF-06463922 and foretinib.	117638365.0	117638365.0	G	T	ENST00000368508.3	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant,transcript_fusion	NC_000006.11:g.117638365G>T,ENST00000368508.3:c.6076C>A,NM_002944.2:c.6076C>A,NP_002935.2:p.Leu2026Met	9.0	CA365441006	NONE FOUND	CD74-ROS1 L2026M

520	CLTC::ALK	The t(2;17)(p23;q23) translocation results in the CLTC-ALK fusion protein, the most common ALK fusion observed in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). ALK-rearranged DLBCL is less responsive to CHOP chemotherapy. Preclinical work indicates that CLTC-ALK DLBCL is responsive to ALK inhibition in cell lines and mouse models, and two case studies show short response followed by progression when heavily pretreated and advanced ALK-positive DLBCL is treated with crizotinib (one case CLTC-ALK, one case an unknown ALK fusion).	57697219.0	57768072.0	None	None	ENST00000269122.3	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	19.0	None	None	T(2;17)(P23;Q23),CLTC-ALK

527	ALK Fusion I1171	Multiple case reports indicate that the I1171T missense mutation in ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) confers resistance to crizotinib and alectinib but is sensitive to ceritinib treatment. These results have been validated in vitro. In vitro evidence indicates this mutation interferes with alectinib binding the active site of ALK and may explain the sensitivity to the structurally distinct ALK inhibitor ceritinib.	29445213.0	29445213.0	A	G	ENST00000389048.3	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant,transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3:c.3512T>C,NC_000002.11:g.29445213A>G,NM_004304.4:c.3512T>C,NP_004295.2:p.Ile1171Thr	42.5	CA346462880	375888	ALK FUSION ILE1171
528	EML4::ALK  V1180L	The V1180L missense mutation was identified in a mutagenesis screen to find mutations that conferred resistance to alectinib in a non-small cell lung cancer cell line. This mutation shows resistance to crizotinib and alectinib but sensitivity to TAE684, ceritinib and more mild sensitivity to brigatinib. Similar to I1171T, it resides in the ATP pocket of ALK and likely interferes with alectinib and crizotinib binding as a mechanism of resistance.	29443679.0	29443679.0	C	G	ENST00000389048.3	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant,transcript_fusion	ENST00000389048.3:c.3538G>C,NC_000002.11:g.29443679C>G,NP_004295.2:p.Val1180Leu,NM_004304.5:c.3538G>C	13.0	CA346473150	NONE FOUND	EML4-ALK VAL1180LEU,EML4-ALK  V1180L

551	ALK Fusion F1245C	In neuroblastoma, F1245 is one of three hotspot ALK mutations found at a high frequency. In a case study, a pretreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient with EML4-ALK F1245C mutation responded well to ceritinib after slow disease progression during crizotinib treatment. Crizotinib resistance was attributed to the F1245C mutation, although the ALK-rearrangement was not sequenced prior to crizotinib treatment. The patient's slow onset of disease progression during crizotinib treatment mirrors preclinical findings that indicate ALK-fusion with F1245C has moderate resistance to crizotinib compared to the fusion alone.	29436859.0	29436859.0	A	C	ENST00000389048.3	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant,transcript_fusion	NM_004304.4:c.3734T>G,NP_004295.2:p.Phe1245Cys,NC_000002.11:g.29436859A>C,ENST00000389048.3:c.3734T>G	14.5	CA279597	217856	RS863225283,ALK FUSION PHE1245CYS

These mutations are typically heterozygous and in the absence of JAK2 and MPL mutations. Approximately 80% of observed mutations are type 1 (p.L367fs*46), the result of a 52 bp deletion, or type 2 (p.K385fs*47), the result of a 5-bp TTGTC insertion, and studies have suggested phenotypic and prognostic differences between them. In PMF patients, CALR exon 9 mutations have been associated with improved median survival.	13054527.0	13054727.0	None	None	ENST00000316448.5	75.0	GRCh37	exon_variant	None	80.0	None	None	None

These fusions have been described in histologically distinctive soft tissue tumours showing a pericytic phenotype.  Gene fusions retain the DNA-binding zinc finger domains of GLI1 and it is likely that the replacement of the promoter region of GLI1with that of the ubiquitously expressed ACTB gene leads to deregulation of GLI expression and its downstream target genes.

1260	C609Y	There is some functional evidence that this variant leads to reduced RET activity (PMID: 9230192) and increased cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis (PMID: 16715139). It has been widely reported in both familial and sporadic cases of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 with medullary thyroid cancers. Despite extensive WGS and Exome coverage for a combined total of ~150k alleles in the GNOMAD browser, this variant has never been observed.	43609070.0	43609070.0	G	A	ENST00000355710.3	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	NM_020630.4:c.1826G>A,NC_000010.10:g.43609070G>A,NP_065681.1:p.Cys609Tyr,ENST00000355710.3:c.1826G>A	20.0	CA007824	13933	CYS609TYR

1300	CONSERVED DOMAIN MUT	This conserved domain mutation variant covers mutations in regions of p53 reported to be highly conserved during evolution. These regions span codons 117-143 (region II), 171-181 (region III), 234-258 (region (IV), and 270-286 (region V). Region I covers approximately codons 10 through 25 but does not appear in all studies on conserved domain mutations. There is overlap with these regions and reported regions of hotspot p53 mutations, where it is observed that hotspots for detrimental mutation correspond to more highly evolutionary conserved regions. While there is agreement and overlap between different reports, the literature does not seem to indicate an exact consensus on these regions of human p53 at this time, but the four highly conserved regions are part of the DNA binding domain, and are reported to exist within codons 97 to 292.	7577062.0	7579398.0	None	None	ENST00000269305.4	75.0	None	None	None	15.0	None	None	None

1739	R167Q (c.500G>A)	R167Q is the most common point mutation in hereditary Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and disrupts the VHL genes binding to elongin C reducing the levels of the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) E3 ligase complex and inhibiting the ability of VHL to regulate HIF2α. This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.	10191507.0	10191507.0	G	A	ENST00000256474.2	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	NM_000551.3:c.500G>A,NP_000542.1:p.Arg167Gln,NC_000003.11:g.10191507G>A,ENST00000256474.2:c.500G>A	95.0	CA020454	2216	C.500G>A,ARG167GLN,RS5030821

1956	E70K (c.208G>A)	The VHL gene has a low rate of benign missense variation and is known to be definitively associated with VHL disease. The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.	10183739.0	10183739.0	G	A	ENST00000256474.2	75.0	GRCh37	missense_variant	NM_000551.3:c.208G>A,NP_000542.1:p.Glu70Lys,NC_000003.11:g.10183739G>A,ENST00000256474.2:c.208G>A	45.0	CA020108	43598	C.208G>A,GLU70LYS,RS5030802

2286	Fusion	NRG1 fusions have been described in cases of invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. In many cases these tumors were negative for the more common known driver genes of these diseases (e.g., KRAS wild-type pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma). These events have been proposed as an attractive therapeutic target and some promising results have been observed with pan-HER inhibitors such as afatinib.

2416	K28M	K28M is a highly recurrent mutation in this gene in multiple cancer types but particularly well known in brain cancers. In amino acid position 27 of H3F3A there is an arginine (R). The medically relevant Lysine (K) is in position 28. Also UNIPROT records the lysine in position 28. However, K27M is common in the literature so is included as a synonym.	226064434.0	226064434.0	A	T	ENST00000366813.1	105.0	GRCh38	non_conservative_missense_variant	ENST00000366813.1:c.83A>T,ENSP00000355778.1:p.Lys28Met	50.0	CA16602870	376435	K27M

2660	NUP214::ABL1	The NUP214 -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the NUP214 (Nucleoporin 214) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 34 of NUP214 to exon 2 of ABL1 (NUP214-ABL1 34-2). In T-ALL, the fusion is typically expressed from amplified extrachromosomal bodies (episomes) that arise when the genomic region from ABL1 to NUP214 circularizes to generate the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The case report that illustrates the clinical significance of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion describes a 6-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with normal karyotype. Both patients demonstrated minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy, and later experienced relapse after either consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Dasatinib was then prescribed and follow-up information is available for the older child, who successfully achieved a complete response for three months before succumbing to the disease. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).	134000948.0	134106156.0	None	None	ENST00000359428.5	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	27.0	None	None	NUP214-ABL1

2678	SNX2::ABL1	The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).	122110691.0	122135550.0	None	None	ENST00000379516.2	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	30.5	None	None	SNX2-ABL1
2847	EBF1::JAK2	The EBF1-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the EBF1 (Early B-Cell Factor Transcription Factor 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 14 of EBF1 to exon 17 of JAK2 (EBF1-JAK2 14-17). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(5;9) (q33.3;p24), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in one adolescent patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the DNA binding, immunoglobulin-life fold, and helix-loop-helix domains from EBF1 and an intact JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, as confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the EBF1-JAK2 fusion protein has not been performed. Clinical significance: The novel EBF1-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one case for which specific clinical information is unavailable. However, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to the treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).

2681	RCSD1::ABL1	The RCSD1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the RCSD1 (RCS Domain Containing 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 2 or, more frequently, exon 3 of RCSD1 to exon 4 of ABL1 (RCSD1-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(q24.2;q34.12) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the ABL1 SH2, actin binding domain, and tyrosine kinase domain, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The RCSD1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in greater than fifteen pediatric and adult patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. The majority that that were exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs: imatinib, dasatinib, or ponatinib) experienced durable remissions until the TKIs were discontinued. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with TKIs and are the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).

2682	FOXP1::ABL1	The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the FOXP1 (Forkhead box P1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 27 of FOXP1to exon 4 of ABL1 (FOXP1-ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;9)(p12;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and NGS. FOXP1 is critical for the transcriptional regulatory network of B lymphopoiesis; it may also act as a tumor suppressor gene. Absence or deficiency of FOXP1 during early B-cell development may block pro-B cell to pre-B cell development. The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion protein leads to activated tyrosine kinase and may further alter the critical cellular function of these 2 genes. Clinical significance: The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in 3 young adult patients (2 male, 1 female) with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. One patient had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib) added to the chemotherapy regimens, who had bone marrow tested negative for MRD at end of consolidation. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion.	None	None	None	None	None	None	None	transcript_fusion	None	10.0	None	None	FOXP1-ABL1

2846	ATF7IP::JAK2	The ATF7IP-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the ATF7IP (Activating Transcription Factor 7 Interacting Protein) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and a part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 10 of ATF7IP to exon 8 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 10-8), exon 13 of ATF7IP to exon 16 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 13-16), or exon 13 of ATF7IP to exon 17 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 13-17). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;12) (p24;p13.1), and has been identified by RNA sequencing and Sanger sequencing in three adult patients with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil and MDN1 domains from ATF7IP and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The coiled coil domain is hypothesized to constitutively activate the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby upregulating the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Clinical significance: The novel ATF7IP-JAK2 fusion has been documented in three cases for which specific clinical information is unavailable. A pre-clinical xenograft model containing the fusion was sensitive to exposure to the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib. Therefore, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. The published breakpoint joins exon 9 of STRN3 to exon 17 of JAK2 (STRN3 -JAK2 9-17). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;14) (p24;q12), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in one pediatric patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the Striatin domain from STRN3 and the JH2 pseudokinase domain and intact JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, as confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the STRN3-JAK2 fusion protein has not been performed. Clinical significance: The novel STRN3-JAK2 fusion has been documented in a single case for which specific clinical information is unavailable. However, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. The published breakpoint joins exon 39 of TPR to exon 17 of JAK2 (TPR -JAK2 39-17). The fusion stems from a reciprocal translocation t(1;9) (q31.1;p24), and has been identified by FISH and RNA sequencing in one young adult patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the TPR/MLP1/MLP2-like protein domain from TERF2 and the JH2 pseudokinase domain and intact JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, as confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the TPR-JAK2 fusion protein has not been performed.

2859	ETV6::JAK2	The ETV6-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the ETV6 (ETS Variant Transcription Factor 6) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 4 of ETV6 to exon 17 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 4-17), exon 5 of ETV6 to exon 12 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 5-12), or exon 5 of ETV6 to exon 19 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 5-19). The fusion results from the reciprocal translocation t(9;12)(p24;p13), cytogenetically cryptic, and has been identified by FISH and RNA sequencing. The fusion gene is expressed from the der(9) chromosome. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the PNT domain from ETV6 and JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. The ETV6 PNT domain is hypothesized to result in dimerization, which leads to aberrant JAK2 kinase domain activation. Depending on the breakpoint variant, the fusion protein may also contain the JAK2 JH2 pseudokinase domain. The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functional effects and disease specificity of the abnormal fusion. Functionally, the fusion results in aberrant activation of JAK2 kinase, leading to activation of downstream signaling through the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The ETV6-JAK2 fusion is associated with hematologic malignancies and has been observed in B-lymphoblastic leukemia (~10%), T-lymphoblastic leukemia (isolated cases), and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and gene rearrangements (rare cases). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion in B-lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion has been associated with high-risk disease. As a predictive marker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion has been shown by limited pre-clinical data and case reports to predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to treatment of pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 14 of BCR to exon 17 of JAK2 (BCR-JAK2 4-17) and exon 1 of BCR to exons 15 (BCR-JAK2 1-15), 17 (BCR-JAK2 1-17), or 19 (BCR-JAK2 1-19). The fusion results from the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(p24;p11.2), and has been identified by karyotype analysis, FISH, RT-PCR, targeted ligation amplification (TLA), and RNA sequencing. The fusion gene is expressed from the der(9) chromosome. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from BCR and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. Depending on the breakpoint variant, the fusion protein may also contain the JAK2 JH2 pseudokinase domain. In pre-clinical studies, the coiled coil domain of BCR has been shown to mediate oligomeric activation of the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby promoting downstream signaling by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The BCR-JAK2 fusion is associated with hematologic malignancies and has been observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms with eosinophilia (multiple cases), B-lymphoblastic leukemia (multiple cases), acute myeloid leukemia (a rare case), and B-cell lymphoma (rare case of Burkitt lymphoma). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker in B-lymphoblastic leukemia, the BCR-JAK2 fusion is frequently observed in the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the fusion appears to be associated with high-risk disease in pediatric and adult populations. As a predictive marker, patients whose diseases exhibit the BCR-JAK2 fusion have experienced partial responses or even complete remission with hydroxyurea and/or interferon alfa. Case reports have demonstrated the limited utility of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. One patient diagnosed with a myeloid neoplasm initially responded to the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, but relapsed after 18 months. Current research has suggested a survival advantage following allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation.	None	None	None	None	None	None	None	transcript_fusion	None	35.0	None	None	BCR-JAK2

2861	PAX5::JAK2	The PAX5-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the PAX5 (Paired Box 5) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 5 of PAX5 to exon 19 of JAK2 (PAX5-JAK2 5-19). The fusion is hypothesized to result from an intrachromosomal translocation, inversion, or deletion of chromosome 9 (involving loci p13 and p24), and has been identified by RNA sequencing, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and FISH in patients B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the DNA-binding paired domain from PAX5 and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. A pre-clinical study has revealed that this fusion protein deregulates the PAX5 transcriptional pathway while also autophosphorylating the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby promoting downstream signaling by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker, the PAX5-JAK2 fusion in B-lymphoblastic leukemia is frequently associated with the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the fusion has been associated with intermediate to high-risk disease. As a predictive marker, the PAX5-JAK2 fusion has been shown in pre-clinical data to predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).

2974	OFD1::JAK2	The OFD1-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the OFD1 (Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. OFD1 is a centrosomal protein of primary cilia implicated in Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome type 1, but it has not been previously described in hematologic malignancies. The published breakpoint joins exon 22 of OFD1 to exon 13 of JAK2 (OFD1-JAK2 22-13). This fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(X;9)(p22;p24), and has been identified in two patients by RNA sequencing, one of which demonstrated the abnormal karyotype 46,XY,-17+mar[11]/46,XY[9]. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the FERM and SH2 domains from OFD1 and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein is reportedly underway. Clinical significance: The novel OFD1-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 3-year-old and one 11-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Both children successfully maintained first complete remission following induction chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with as long as 6 years of follow up. While neither patient was treated with a JAK2 inhibitor, the JH1 kinase domain present within the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to the treatment of pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).

2975	SMU1::JAK2	The SMU1-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the SMU1 (SMU1 DNA Replication Regulator and Splicesomal Factor) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 18 of SMU1 to exon 12 of JAK2 (SMU1-JAK2 18-12). The fusion is hypothesized to result from an intrachromosomal translocation, inversion, or deletion of chromosome 9 (involving loci p21 and p24), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in an older adult patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the LisH, CTLH, HisP, and Wd40 domains from SMU1 and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. Pre-clinical data demonstrates increased JH1 kinase expression as a result of the SMU1-JAK2 fusion event, which is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Clinical significance: The novel SMU1-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one case for which specific clinical information is unavailable. However, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. The published breakpoint joins exon 18 of SNX29 to exon 13 of JAK2 (SNX29 -JAK2 18-13). It is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;16) (p24;q13.13), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in one normal-karyotype adult patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the RUN and PX_RUN domains from SNX29 and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the SNX29-JAK2 fusion protein has not been performed. Clinical significance: The novel SNX29-JAK2 fusion has been documented in a single case that successfully maintained complete remission without relapse following induction chemotherapy. While the patient was not treated with a JAK2 inhibitor, the JH1 kinase domain present within the SNX29-JAK2 fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 4 of ZNF430 to exon 19 of JAK2 (ZNF430-JAK2 4-19). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;19)(p24;p12), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in one adult patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the KRAB_A-box domain from ZNF430 and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs).

3214	GOLGA5::JAK2	The GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the GOLGA5 (Golgin A5) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 10 of GOLGA5 to exon 12 of JAK2 (GOLGA5-JAK2 10-12). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;14)(p24;q32), and has been identified in one patient by RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from GOLGA5 and an aberrantly activated JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, which is thought to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The novel GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 10-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with complex karyotype. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. A xenograft model created from the patient's malignant cells demonstrated clearance of the leukemic clone in murine peripheral blood upon exposure to ruxolitinib. Moreover, this drug was added to the child's treatment regimen, resulting in nearly undetectable levels of the GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion measured after 64 days of therapy. The patient has reportedly remained in remission 20 months after CAR T-cell infusion and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This child was included in the currently ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors in treating pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).

3268	RANBP2::ABL1	The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the RANBP2 (RAN Binding Protein 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 18 of RANBP2 to exon 2 of ABL1 (RANBP2-ABL1 18-2). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(2;9)(p12.3;q34.12) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, includes the leucine zipper of RANBP2 and the tyrosine kinase of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in several juvenile and young adult patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further classified as BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Most of the documented patients were treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (specifically dasatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens, but they eventually experienced relapse and succumbed to their disease. The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).	109336063.0	109375004.0	None	None	ENST00000283195	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	10.0	None	None	RANBP2-ABL1

3269	ZMIZ1::ABL1	The ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the ZMIZ1 (Zinc Finger MIZ-Type Containing 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The most commonly published breakpoint joins exon 18 of ZMIZ1 to exon 2 of ABL1 (ZMIZ1-ABL1 18-2). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(9;10)(q34.12;q22.3) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype, RT-PCR, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, which contains one of the proline-rich domains of ZMIZ1 and the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain. Similar to other oncogenic fusion proteins, the proline-rich domain of ZMIZ1 is involved in protein-protein interactions, and therefore the fusion may encode a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that upregulates the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Patients harboring the ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion are hypothesized to be eligible for imatinib therapy.	80828792.0	81061969.0	None	None	ENST00000334512.5	75.0	GRCh37	transcript_fusion	None	32.5	None	None	ZMIZ1-ABL1

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein.

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein, and the inclusion of the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. The NUP153-ABL1 has been documented in one pediatric patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia, as detected by RNA kinome capture and transcriptome sequencing.

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The fusion is in-frame and it has been documented in two patients with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL). The first patient was a child with high risk Ph-like ALL and the second patient was a 36 years old male who had a poor prednisone response and did not reach complete remission after vincristine-dexamethasone-rituximab or a combination of dasatinib and chemotherapy. The second patient died early of sepsis in a context of uncontrolled disease (survival 2 months).	None	None	None	None	None	None	None	transcript_fusion	None	10.0	None	NONE FOUND	LSM14A-ABL1

3287	SFPQ::ABL1	The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SFPQ (Splicing factor proline and glutamine rich) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 9 of SFPQ to exon 4 of ABL1 (SFPQ -ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(p34;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The role of the partner gene SFPQ in this fusion remains to be investigated. SFPQ encodes for a protein belonging to a new functionally related group of fusion partners for tyrosine kinases involved in pre-mRNA processing. The presence of 2 coiled-coil domains in the 9 remaining exons of SFPQ could theoretically lead to SFPQ–ABL1 oligomerization, thus leading to constitutive activation of the resulting tyrosine kinase, as reported with other partner genes. Though uncommon, this translocation might be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Clinical significance: The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion has been documented in six patients (3 male, 3 female) between the ages of 10 and 34 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens, who did not have relapse. One additional patient who did not have tyrosine kinase inhibitor also did not suffer from relapse. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion.	None	None	None	None	None	None	None	transcript_fusion	None	32.5	None	None	SFPQ-ABL1

CSF1R is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The breakpoint is not published, but is predicted to be the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;5)(q26.32;q32) and has been identified by RNA sequencing in a single pediatric patient. The consequence of this fusion with respect to treatment response and disease outcome is unknown.	None	None	None	None	None	None	None	transcript_fusion	None	7.5	None	None	TBL1XR1-CSF1R
